I was really attracted to some of the nurses and a few of the women patients and a couple of the interns but barely did anything about it.
176107941,"Obviously I’ll discuss with pdoc but thats not till September… i had a psychosis lasting a day a few days ago due to lack of sleep or possibly due to starting sertraline … im quite scared … i wasn’t expecting it to happen as I’ve been working with the psychologist who said I should put myself in difficult situations even though i feel like I’m losing touch with reality , as its not likely to happen … well it happened she was wrong …"

176107959,"_AT_MENTION_ No need to apologise for the length of your post; I appreciated it and found it interesting. I hope to eventually get their help in finding some sort of supported housing, as one of the factors in my relapse is loud building work (drills, hammers, goodness knows what else) that’s been going on just the other side of my wall for literally half a decade, minus a few periods of a few months during which the work stopped. It’s been busier and louder than ever this year and the building manager of that property doesn’t know when they may finish. I’ve no idea what type of building reconstruction takes five years, including five years of daily hammering and drilling in one and the same room. It’s literally driving me insane (though there are other factors and triggers as well) and I have no easy way to escape from it. It’s 8am to 5pm Monday to Friday and 8am to around 2pm on Saturdays. I bought a white noise machine which I switch on in the mornings when they start, so that I can 
continue sleeping (I need a lot of sleep) but even the white noise machine at full volume plus ear plugs doesn’t usually drown it all out, so I’m increasingly sleep deprived as well as assaulted by horrible noise, plus there are other builders who have been working on some scaffolding that’s directly outside my window for the past three months…and during the summer there were also builders working in my building, directly outside my door, for a month or two…so the feeling of intrusion and persecution from all this has been hellish. So we’ll just have to wait and see what happens with my CMHT."
176107960,"I think if it starts some time after use it can be considered triggered by the drug. As in, you had the underlying issue and it was triggered to surface.

176108037,"I’ve been making a lot of threads lately lol. Anyway… I feel like lately I’ve been extremely negative, moreso than usual. To be fair, I’ve had stuff going on that’s been dragging down my perspective, but I think it’s about time for a fresh start. For a while I was fixated on the ostensible fact that my life was forever tainted by my psychotic break two years ago and its aftermath. But I did prove to myself that I can still succeed, that I wasn’t and am not at a complete standstill in life. I’ve worked since my episode and started a relationship with an amazing guy whom I just celebrated my eight month anniversary with. Now that I’m sort of past that negative attitude about my psychosis, I’ve had family stuff going on that’s been leaving me dwelling on mortality which isn’t a healthy place for my mind to go for extended periods of time. I want to look past all this stuff to what I hope is a bright future. I need a renewed sense of purpose; it’s just a matter of finding what 
will grant me that. I think a new job or a return to school could be what I need right now, but who knows. I’ve been wanting to learn Mandarin and everyone keeps encouraging me to pursue that and take it seriously. I could join the local mental health clubhouse like my psychiatric nurse practitioner advised me to do last year (I immediately chickened out lol, sad). I could volunteer. I could campaign for politicians I like (though how healthy that would be for a sz, I have no idea). I have options. I just need to pick something and stick with it, which I’m notoriously horrible at. My upcoming therapy appointment will be a fun time, for sure."

176108059,"Oh, sorry. I guess I went for it in the end because there is a difference between blaming problems on yourself and understanding them. I also sometimes wonder about problems from autism debilitating you from overcoming problems from psychosis."
176108060,"Sheer disbelief and an eventual cracking in the armor of the believability of the experience. Psychosis is good at keeping a sufferer confinced… it will turn the sufferer against themselves just to gain traction and have the sufferer then set back into fear established by the trauma of the onset experience of psychosis… and whatever delusions or superstitions that may have pre-existed the presence of the illness. I still have symptoms… but they have fallen from being an ongoing occurrence… to something that only has a real impact on me about 5 times a day or so. Which is significantly better… I can move away from the psychosis and psychotic thinking if I can keep the number that low… It’s more about feeling than thinking… though the two are intertwined. I’d say that you gotta pay attention to what things are like when you aren’t struggling with it so bad… take to any little break you get with attention… let the peace of it set in. You basically have to rebuild your own brain 
and state of being… and it just takes the choice to empower what is good… and the wisdom to avoid the states that are bad. People can’t hear your thoughts… nor see the innards of your mental experience… people can read each other to some extent but that is entirely from the outside. What is actually happened is that your attention and the way your mind documents the presence of other people has been become hallucinatorily exaggerated and turned against you. It is like being in a waking dream… the subconscious is just that quick and creative… it will try to keep you spooked. As far as what actually broke down and allowed this to happen in a lot of our minds is still more or less a mystery. I think it is just abnormal brain behavior… like autism… expect is hardly respected on the same level, because it doesn’t take much for us to start seeming more functional… and because of this everyone else has a natural bias to have normal expectations from us… even though we more or less are trapped 
in another world. Keep strong, keep talking with us… this is a great site for sorting out your own thinking and finding a feeling of not being alone in the struggle. You’ll find support of all kinds… even if you find folks you don’t agree with."

I feel like aliens were behind it…went to the highest levels of government…i was so scared and trapped and helpless… I have some ideas why."

174369461,"A psychiatrist might determine if a person is insane, but it’s the jury who decides their fate if it goes to trial. If I was on the jury and I heard someone blatantly say, and I’m paraphrasing, “I’m a schizophrenic do you know what I can do to you?”… well let’s just say its damning at best. It not only shows complete awareness of ones actions, but also cognizant enough to know that the illness is stigmatized enough to be used as a threat. People get angry, and people do stupid stuff when they are angry. _AT_MENTION_ I’m in no way making judgment on you, and I sincerely hope you get help with your anger, but please think about the community of which you are apart of before using an already stigmatized illness as a threat. It seriously damages the rest of us who deal with this stuff daily. A few weeks ago I made an appointment with an audiologist and the secretary was helping me schedule one. I had to take a hearing test and mentioned my sza, and she got scared and asked if anyone wil

Ive been thinking about it for awhile and it feels like its open to interpretation. I was blacked out when i said it and i swear i scared the psychiatrist because the light in the hospital room burnt out while i was in a different state of mind. The few things i came.up with -this is a simulation and many of us are here against our will to do the simulation until whenever -aliens are watching us and this is indeed a prison planet -the united states (stars) is holding my country hostage(canada) -the police (stars) are imprisoning my people, native americans -the stars are sentient objects and control what we see and do I would love to hear any interpretation about the weird thing i said during black out psyc

Sometimes I will think about something and get mad like at another person in me and will look in space like I am looking at them but I do not see anything. My thoughts are very odd. Sometimes they say weird things about a son having aids. I do not have a son. Sometimes my thoughts will say I want a steak and cheese when I really wanted a tortilla. Sometimes the thoughts think Can I snuggle you? Referring to myself. Sometimes the thoughts say things like thats my mommy but she doesn’t care about me. Referring to a caregiver of mine. She is not my parent. Sometimes the thoughts are loud or so strange it actual startles me. Does this sound like Dissociative Identity Disorder or Schizophrenia?

176108129,I am thankful…it is quite a relief to be truthful to finally have answers. Real answers. I just wish it hadn’t took so long for me to receive the diagnosis and be aware. I fought my own truth about my symptoms. Maybe deep down I was terrified everyone would be scared of me. My moms best friend was diagnosed _PERSON_ and she came to visit around same time I started hallucinating at age 5 and mom locked our bedroom door cause she was scared of her. I didn’t understand why bc she seemed so nice. I didn’t want my mom scared of me too. I know I’m adult now but I guess that stayed with me.

But when I’m like that, I come to this forum and realize that the people here are so similar to me because of the fact that I’m actually ill. My advice is to come here when you’re feeling this way. Once you’re out of the hospital, join a support group for mentally ill people with psychosis or related conditions. If you don’t already have a therapist, maybe find one whom you can talk about this to. Maybe they can help you come to terms with being mentally ill. hugs"

176108173,"Hey everyone, I had an odd experience last night that I’ve never had hapoen before. It was evening time and I started hearing a female voice. She was berating me, saying the government is watching me and that I’m an experiment in the final level of a simulation. I did my thought challenging and was able to disregard all of her attempts to cloud my thinking. Then out of no where she became extremely sexual. Saying dirty things, calling me sexual names, moaning, etc. It was pretty uncomfortable and I’ve never had it happen. Just wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, and what you did to kind of ignore it? It kept me awake for over an hour."
176108174,Why do you do that ? Apologize all the time.

176108233,"In my early twenties I dreadfully feared going through the world alone; living day to day in a menial job I hated working just to experience another empty and lonely day. It became quickly apparent that I wanted a relationship that I could trust like I trusted my parents and friends whom I would trust like family. But when your only parent and company left in the world is a mother who is dying and your brothers and sisters are all hardcore _PERSON_ conservatives who feel strongly that you were an unnecessary and excess child you begin looking to strangers. That field of strangers is filled with people who are too damaged, superficial and self-centered to really bother with someone of average looks and low income. You start to realize that there are only a few like you in this world; a person who sees others as company but most of those others regard the people around them as disposable, rent-able and upgrade able like automobiles. The vast majority of humans also fulfill ego by belonging to various 
constituencies rather they are seemingly sharing the same religions, politics or attitudes and collectively act passive-aggressively; discriminating those who don’t subscribe to their same spoon-fed templates. In this world your brother is not your keeper, your partner is only there until they can afford better and your employers will respect you as nothing more than an easily replaceable and expendable machine. Despite all of the above, the trick to contentment is simply to sit back quietly, under radar and watch and learn. You’ll find that no matter how dreadful the road up ahead looks you will make it by on a wing and a prayer and you’ll also find hobbies and other interests that make each day worth a bit more to wake up to, thus even if we don’t really ever find that world sold to us when we were children. Because I am pretty sure that everyone here on Earth is broken in some manner and why we are here in the first place; it’s not a good place to set up nest. Or as _PERSON_ once revealed to _NAM
E_; “Sorry, _NAME_ but your princess is in another castle.”"
176108234,Today I felt like I’m gonna break… idk what happens when I hit that point but it can’t be good… I took my new med and am high as a kite but I know it won’t last
174369504,The treatment for most psychotic disorders are the same. As long as your meds are working a diagnosis is just a label. If they don’t work keep trying to find something better. I would like to feel better but I am afraid to experiment with new meds because I am stable and I have been very unstable. So it’s a double edged sword. It’s a crap shoot really.
174369505,"Oh, I can relate to that, I’m addicted to eating meat pies. I cut out wheat and dairy a little while ago and my positive symptoms improved. I am back to wheat and dairy now, but it still seems to be a bit better than before."

176108251,I’m so sorry. That must be so hard on you. Contact your pdoc and let them know what’s going on. They’ll be able to diagnose you
176108252,Nobody is following you. It would be really expensive for the government to tale you around. Some people might be headed the same place as you or close to.

176108264,"_PERSON_ i know i stop doing it a month ago. should i be worried, will anyone be after me."
174369524,Oh yeah for sure. Far too many psychiatrists just have the goal of eliminating positive symptoms. They do not care if the meds in the process of doing so give side effects so debilitating that the person’s functioning and quality of life is as bad as it was off meds. The goal of psychopharmacology should not be the elimination of symptoms; it should be the improvement of function and quality of life.

For part of that knowledge I thank a lot of the women on here and the women at work and just other women in general while I go about my day. Other guys can be cool but they’re just in the way.

174369512,"Hi _NAME_, I know the feeling all too well. Schizophrenia is so challenging. The thoughts, emotions, feelings it brings you just never know what your going to get. I just want to say hang in there. We are all in this together! Best wishes."

I’m really picky about dating, but I think it’s more than just what my parents want. My last bf just made me wish I could be asexual… but you don’t seem as bad as him. Relationships aren’t something you can force to happen. I hope you find someone you’re happy with. Lots of guys I met at support group are in healthy relationships. Don’t give up!"
176108298,"Oh really? No I haven’t looked into too much to be honest. But a quick search says that: “CBD is the dominant cannabinoid in hemp plant” And that “Hemp fibre or seed strains will be relatively high in CBD compared to THC” It also goes on to note that industrial produced hemp can be low in both, but I see no reason why that would be the case in wild marijuana plants. Both I think are an abuse of the natural plant. Industrial companies altering plants to get more fibre and seeds etc and drug companies (including illegal ones) altering plants to get more of what they want (a high). natural ditch-weed or ferral marijuana is best is my guess. A high CBD content compared to THC content, but also not devoid of nutrients like most GMO food is."
176108299,yea that is good that you pep talk yourself =) I’d give the med change a go and see how you do but that is just me…

176108307,I do not know where to start and if people would be able to understand the pain I am going through… Firstly most common visitors here know me. I am diagnosed BD 1 and Schizo. Not sure what is correct. Anyway I am tired of visiting docs alone. There is zero support for my illness from my family. So taking dark chocolate 90% 1 sq/day as medicine. Nowadays I get the feeling there is no respect for me anywhere. I am battling the negative thoughts almost every moment. So slightest of condescending tone puts me on edge. And I live in my own world. Not sure where it will get me to. There are some acquaintance who look up to me. But they are not close and influential. I am hardly able to remember them during tough times. Are there anyone who is very kind and non-judgmental in the world and not care about the past of a person? Let me explain about zero support. They know I have illness which according to them is my character which needs to be corrected. There is no mercy or sympathy for me as they conclude
d I am either violent or unreasonable which I am not for past 3 years. I don’t know if they will realise or not. Enough of myself. What could be my next logical step? Docs and Medicines are waste if people around me going to behave the same way. I can explain more if there are open ears.

I read online that apparently 800mg is known as the highest effective dose, although you can go up to 1.2g a day Not sure if I want to do this or not This morning was pretty rough - I have been tormented by intrusive thoughts that are starting to become worse and even audible sometimes. Really don’t want to up my meds. They need to sort my sleep out I think, and then things will be better I was up at 3:30am this morning, and barely slept and done a full days work Just ate a take out pizza to try and give me some energy, as I am starting to feel really sick and like I have flu with chills etc. Not sure things are going right at the moment med wise, but I really don’t know whether to up the dose of this medication without even speaking to my proper pdoc at least on the phone"

174369530,"I’m looking for input from folks who have been on both drugs. What did they do for your positive , negative, and cognitive symptoms, one versus the other? and if you have depression, which exerted a more potent antidepressant effect for you? What did it feel like to be on the one drug compared to the other? I might consider loxapine to replace my olanzapine as I have diabetes, high triglycerides, am obese, and have stage 3 fatty liver disease, and I’ve heard loxapine doesn’t annihilate your metabolism like clozapine or olanzapine. I’ve taken clozapine as well and found it too draining with not enough of an antidepressant effect for me, which is very important as I’m on 90 mg of Nardil and I rely upon adjuncts with it to pull me out because my depression is so severe. Also, loxapine turns into amoxapine in the body, which could help with my ADHD as it acts as an NRI in part, no?"

Just you believing it can lead you to metal illness, just check yourself your not based in the reality that normal people are in, normal people dont think about reptillian aliens, they dont even know it exists. You can research it all you want and eventually youll start to believe. But if you look at it with reality glasses on, there is no proof of reptillian aliens no pictures no proof of truth of it, and until there is, im gonna forget about it, cause its just a waste of time thinking about it. It will only make you delusional. Being isolated and doing drugs will only reinforce the delusion. You dont have schizophrenia yet but if you keep doing what your doing you will get schizophrenia, the delusions will turn into reality and you will start to hear voices. Thats how it starts with delusions"
176108357,"(Disclaimer: I’m not trying with this post neither to discredit or to validate the religious experience. Please don’t turn this into a religious discussion. I only seek to clarify the criteria for diagnosing delusions). Prior to my alleged SZ onset I held no religious beliefs. Since then part of me has become convinced that the universe was created by an evil demiurge/devil. The nature of religious conversion is, of course, complex and we should avoid the temptation of being too reductive. Nonetheless, it is difficult not to feel suspicious about such a sudden ‘spiritual’ development. Things are further complicated by the standard understanding of delusion as a belief at odds with the cultural background of the individual holding that belief. It could be argued against this that with internet age and the growing fluidity in the construction of personal identities, that such a distinction is obsolete, that I’m simply establishing creative, digitally mediated, cultural ties with ancient str
ands of christianity, who also argued the universe was the handiwork of an evil demiurge. How can I know whether my (part-time) belief in an evil creator is a legitimate religious belief or a delusion? Any insights will be welcome."

176108402,"Blue, purple, black"
176108403,"Actually I think it is a very good sign that so much time passed before you relapsed. I think that suggests you might be able to get well at some point. I mean you quit drugs in september and relapsed in february. All traces of the olanzapine must have left you body within a month I’d say is probable. So you were actually functioning a long while with no help from meds. When I have quit olanzapine in the past I always relapsed within 1 1/2 month. You are way past that. I think you could maybe make it without drugs, but you need to keep stress at a minimum since that triggers you. Maybe get a job with little responsibility where there always are people who can step in if you get sick or whatever and generally try to keep your life level and do stuff that makes you relax while avoiding stressors the best you can. Get some valium or other sedative that you can use occassionally when stress peaks. If I were in your shoes I’d try to get off the ap’s again when you are stable. If it took many month

It was only switching my meds that made my weight lower. I think for people who are susceptible to weight gain as a side effect, it will happen no matter how much personal effort you put into it. Switching meds has been great for me so far. I would be hesitant to try a brand new med, but it has a pretty low side effect profile so far."

176108450,Hey _AT_MENTION_. How was your lunch?
176108451,Random nausea is probably the most prominent side effect I’ve experienced thus far. Also I’m rarely satisfied with fewer than twelve hours of sleep.
176108452,"Yup,I think the fact I wasn’t on AP’s for the better part of two decades, self medicating with drugs, left a lasting impact. I still hallucinate, still lose insight. The meds have helped a lot to decrease the symptoms, but nothing has taken them away completely."

I may think about coincs almost all time and do not have any hallucinations, perceptual distortions. I have ruling of moderate level of disability due to mental illness which helped me finding job for some months. Now I am unemployed since about 5,5 months. I do not have an idea about my occupational career. I think that if I would have hallucinations I would think that they are from devil. I was more excitated due to coincidences just after their beginning than now.

176108494,"I’ve read hundreds of stories on the internet about people who quit Olanzapine and couldn’t sleep afterwards, but the docs deny it’s the Olanzapine because this problem hasn’t been written up in the literature. For some people it seems like it is not possible to go off it. They have chronic unrelenting insomnia and need to go back on it, sometimes going back on it doesn’t work.I read a story about a person that killed themselves because of it. That is where I am at. I quit Olanzapine, couldn’t sleep, went back on it but have to take sleeping pills now. It’s not fun.I’m in the process of increasing my Olanzapine from 2.5mg to see if I can sleep again."

I know it’s annoying when people who’ve overcome negatives tell people who haven’t that they need to try harder, but you’re not even trying. You’re just whining that there’s on magic pill that removes all your problems so you won’t have to work on them. Lobotomies are permanent. There’s no going back. With schizophrenia, there’s always room for improvement, and a chance of getting better. Having a lobotomy gives you no chance, it turns you into a drooling zombie."

Theoretically, a case may outwardly resemble schizophrenia without being that. That is one reason why doctors should try to listen and understand what their patients are saying. It can be difficult enough to explain even when/if they are reasonably empathic. That said, schizophrenia is special/different in some fundamental ways, eg. in that it affects the person’s very experience of reality; ie. the person hears things others do not even if they are in the same physical location. Diabetes does not do that. -A."

If you are okay with being used for sex though, that is your choice. If you really want to see him, just dont have sex with him. It will show you his intentions quickly. Also, what are you getting from this? Why do you do this? Do you feel lonely… ? Is there another way to deal with that?"

176108544,"I have decided that in combating depression it’s important to set goals. It’s not good to merely stagnate. For me I need something to look forward to, something to work towards. It gives me hope. Hope is key to keeping out of depression, at least in the deep of it. The more hope you have the better off you are. But I’ve also found that too many plans and too high of a goal can be equally depressing because when you can’t achieve your goals or make any headway you feel down about yourself. So there’s a balance there. Somewhere there’s a balance and I’m going to find it. So I think the takeaways are to set reasonable, attainable goals and don’t get down on yourself if you can’t reach your goal or if it takes longer. And remember your no worse off for trying."

I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo

174369590,"I’m eloquent, especially on the topic of insight into my own psychology & mental illness. I _NAME_ an annotated diagram of my insights for my last clinical psychologist in order to avoid weeks of, “let’s get you insightful”. She studied it for a week, asked if she could make copies to show all her colleagues and said, “I don’t think you realise how insightful you are”. I fired her. I mask my psychotic illness very well & spent years at university bettering my intellect and vocabulary; lecturers often told me to publish my work. I had years of therapy going un-diagnosed, no one ever suggested I see a psychiatrist or go on medication. The annoying thing for me is that insights never did a damn thing to relieve my symptoms, only ap’s did."

176108624,"The alternatives of not doing something. If I don’t work, the alternative is being broke. BTDT, didn’t like it. The alternative to not maintaining my car in a timely manner: it breaks down and I’m back taking the bus. BTDT for five years. So I take care of my car, making sure it is mechanically sound and keeping it registered and insured. Paying my rent on time, keeping my apartment clean, and refrain from talking to neighbors. The alternative is living in a worse place, possibly a group home. BTDT. I like having my large room to myself. Just three years ago I was sharing a tiny room in a board & care home with some former homeless guy who got kicked out of the marines. By some miracle we got along and didn’t argue a lot. But we had our differences. Finishing my last three classes for my degree. I’ve come too far, I’m too close to give up now.

174369615,"Fairly quickly for me. At age 19 I was put in my first psyche ward, then released to a group home for schizophrenics. After about 4 months of denial my parents took me to a psychiatrist who happen to belong to our church. He talked to all three of us than had my parents leave the room so he could talk to me one-on-one. The first thing he said was that my parents are really worried about me. Then he asked me some questions about my mental state. I told him nothing was wrong with me, that it was my parents who had all the problems and that I was fine. I saw nothing wrong about having to see a psychiatris and living in a house for schizophrenics. I couldn’t put two and two together. Just a few weeks later I was watching TV by myself upstairs (“Dynasty” was on, it was 1980). And it just came to me; maybe I was really ill. Maybe I wasn’t right and maybe all these people weren’t wrong. And that they were right that I was schizophrenic. I accepted that. The funny thing was that it wasn’t some 
earth shaking revelation, it didn’t change me and didn’t change my life. I didn’t freak out one bit about the realization. And that was 40 years ago and I know it’s a cliche but I never became my illness. It helped that I looked, acted and sounded normal. I pretty much went out in public and I didn’t have to consciously hide it because no one could tell. I spent a year at the home going through hell but I still walked the crowded downtown all the time. I used to go in the donut shop for doughnuts, I had my favorite used book store that I spent a lot of time in, I took walks all over. Hell, a few mornings I got up at 6:00 am, put on my jogging shorts and jogged down the streets before anybody else was out. But yeah, I might be coming a little apart at the seams now due to stress and some other things but most of my 40 years with schizophrenia I’ve done normal things and had lots of normal experiences. Believe me, I’ve felt strong symptoms most of my life. I sat in the comedy clubs and enjoyed the 
different comedians or went out to eat but when I got home I still struggled with this disease, obviously. I sat at the beach or flew across the country, or sat through the air show and I was paranoid and couldn’t relax, but hey, it was fun and like another poster said, I racked up some great memories for my old age. Just as recently as ten years ago my symptoms were pretty bad. I still went to work and functioned but I also sat in front of the TV and ate dinner and had episodes every night where I was an inch away from checking into a hospital. But it’s true for me that my symptoms have gotten “not so bad” as I age. I freak out about the torture from the neighbors but it’s calm right now and my mind is relatively clear, a little lull in the storm and I feel OK. Anyone remember “Dynasty”?"

If you really want to work, and believe you’re stable enough to work, if it were me, I would wait and start working after I completed a bachelor’s or higher degree in a good, money making field of my choice and interest.

I’ve been on a lot of meds over 9 years getting treatment and help. I don’t know if this forum is for me anymore. I feel like this forum is a bastion of freedom and last support for me. I don’t know where else to go. I have had irrational thoughts and have been wrong before like I don’t know how it happened exactly or what type of technology they used on me or how long I was gone. Why hasn’t anyone come forward? I remember being taken through the kitchen to the back in a black vehicle at my cooperative and at least two women saw a group of men escort me. I have nightmares and flashbacks about it. I remember the TR-3B craft at Berkeley by the cafeteria. I’m guessing it was Bohemian Grove aka Illuminati in San _NAME_, Ca, but I don’t know. It’s just on

176108700,Recalled on community treatment order
176108701,Back when i was with my partner i could hear people talking over the fence i got so scared i got my sister to pick me up. My sons father committed suicide and I was terrified his family want to kill me. As soon as the funeral was over I was off to another city. Also I had an old woman helping me around the house and then I felt like she was getting the whole neighborhood to spy o me and poison my food. I had neighbor’s who never opened their curtains I thought they had a machine to control me This was all before contact with mental health. What do you guys think?
176108702,and yea like wallafish says it’s also possible it didn’t bother her that you questioned the dx… but if you feel bad about it then i’d try to tell her…

176108705,Sometimes i think about him. The voices tell me you will see him again don’t grieve. I think to myself i knew my father well enough not to see him again. We told each other everything we needed to know. I remember my fathers most favorite response to a question : “When you don’t that i can’t help you.”

176108775,"Are you using the app or just the mobile browser? I use chrome on my iPhone, and I haven’t had problems."
176108776,So I moved across the province last month. My old pdoc told me to get a family doctor in my new area and have them refer me to mental health services in the new region. We’ve just had an exodus of family doctors in my new town and the remaining ones are not accepting new patients. At all. Trying to reach the old pdoc to see if I can get a direct referral from her. The good news is that – being in my fifties – I’ve been buggered by _PERSON_’s Theorum enough over the years that I built a hella good Geodon stash. Nine month supply laid in while I get this sorted. Just frustrated with the usual Canadian small town mental health service access issues.
174369655,My aunt said to me the other day when I was doubting my diagnosis that she had always thought they’d got it wrong. Like me telling her she doesn’t have lupus.
174369650,video games masterbating walking all these things stess me out.
176108777,Very cool good job
176108778,"i was on it briefly for symptoms of bipolar. dr kept wanting to check my valproic acid. personally, i think it was prescribed because I have a _NAME_ tattoo on my arm. depakote= “depp, a coat”"
176108779,You’d probably elicit a tirade of negativity from me. I’ve have a few hobbies but they don’t sustain me.
176108780,What are your plans to earn money?
176108781,Unless they gave me tranquilisers before introducing any meds (i got some blue pills)… my brothers friends cousin was also in the hospital and she didn’t seem as bad but is still in there two to three months later.
176108782,Try to add some decent exercise. It’s hard work but helps with negs and things like concentration.
176108783,Forget what happened and forgive them. And tell me if tomorrow every other person started to laugh looking at you …so will you lock yourself inside your home??? That is not the right way buddy… stay strong and never let any other person things disturb you… no matter what.
176108784,I attend a local support group for _PERSON_’s… I have quite a few friends I met through them. We do zoom meetings now and chat in facebook groups. Maybe there is something similar near you? Online friendships are nice but it’s nice to have friends who live nearby too. I don’t seem to really connect with the people who go to my church since they seem to kind of look down on people that can’t raise families.
176108785,TBH I’ve always been curious about this. Interesting to see it is true.
176108786,"Have you tried a combo of a weak 2 generation Ap and a strong Ad? I was trying a lot of drugs, before i got some relief and known other schizotypals that are a mess without drugs (legal Ap & Ad, of course)"
176108787,I connected with _AT_MENTION_ . I also miss _AT_MENTION_ she was so enthusiastic despite her struggles and she always had a kind word for anyone. Also _AT_MENTION_ who can rarely be seen on here nowadays.
176108788,Thanks _PHONE_NO_
176108789,I see her every week
176108790,Who is saying what about you?
176108791,_AT_MENTION_ . I feel the same way sometimes like the tv is not talking to me but about me. It’s hard to explain. I usually don’t say much about my delusions. They can be frustrating though. Very frustrating.
176108792,it’s cos it’s not romantic feeling towards family members.
176108793,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_
176108794,"I don’t know. My situation now is abject, but sometimes I think I am where I need to be. I can make a contribution here and do positive things. It’s not a complete loss."
176108795,Is it the ‘wash hands…check stove’ type of OCD? Or some other version.
176108796,"Me bedroom, or in conversation over coffee with friends or family"
176108797,"Whenever I commit a mortal sin, my delusions of reference or “voice”, tells me that I am no longer in His favor and implies that I am on my way to Hell unless I change my ways."
176108798,Amisulpride works well for me but I have high prolactin that they’re looking into at the moment
176108799,I went from 204lbs to 192… I gained some back during November but trying to get back on track and have been doing a good job so far!
176108800,"this sounds like standard psychotic delusion. for me, my full blown psychosis started with delusions and then later it developed into normal volume voices and then other things. so it is good that you are on haldol, i suppose, because that will prevent you from getting worse, hopefully. I know it is not easy to do but just keep challenging your delusions with logic, and saying, no, this is not real, this is not real, acknowledge the thought, but then just say you are not real,(and try to believe that statement whilst saying it) and it will maybe take away some of its power."
176108801,I’m glad you’re alright and your test was negative. Maybe you need a change in medication.
176108802,I cant draw but I really get inspired by YouTube so much on there
176108803,"Caffeine helps me not sleep all day, I still lay in bed but its better than sleeping, at least I am awake and on this forum."
176108804,Stop taking drugs too!
176108805,The one I saw on TV weights 2.8 lbs.
176108806,Celexa and doxepin
176108807,"I lost weight on Geodon. 40 pounds But it stopped working and I had to switch, not sure what this new med is doing to my weight yet."
176108808,"The perfect relationship For me Doesn’t exist, Because I’d be in it."
176108809,"And I say the same for _AT_MENTION_’s book, Out of It."
176108810,Mexico is a very unsafe country to live in especially outside of the tourist areas.
176108811,Almost like they’re projecting.
176108812,I can’t escape that. I feel so guilty.
176108813,"Yes they do. The anti-psychotic med I take is in liquid form and fast acting, and doesn’t need to take daily."
176108814,I’m a dental assistant currently. That’s what I went to school for.
176108815,I’ve heard it said that if you write down goals you are more likely to fulfil them.
176108816,I have vertigo all day and I suspect them. They cause it.
176108817,"Good luck, I hope it works for you."
176108818,"It really is a shame how things are with mental health. I think the UK is not as extreme as the US, but still have a way to go. Sussex Partnership NHS trust is absolutely useless. I have not seen anyone for two months now. They really don’t care. I am just lucky so far this year that I have not had a relapse, as there is literally no safety net."
176108819,Welcome to the forums
176108820,You are adding to the _USER_ID_ by wearing a tinfoil hat _AT_MENTION_. Take that silly thing off.
176108821,I was scared of the dark until my first severe episode and diagnosis. Now I know what causes the paranoia and fear so I just use a nightlight so I can see to use the bathroom.
176108822,What’s a loser to you? People who lose a lot are the most successful at life. They win the numbers game eventually.
176108823,Would this be in the instigator or the target.
176108824,These stupid issues are making it hard to enjoy anything a lot of days. There are questions I have which don’t seem like can get answered because everything has turned into taboo subjects since it triggers people. Well great. Let’s not discuss the possibility of there being no more farming in 60 years or so? That’s not important? Is everything really just going to …
176108825,but i feel like they were just intrusive thoughts not delusions
176108826,I do drink a lot of water too. To stay hydrated. I sometimes feel dehydrated.
176108827,My last A1C test a few days ago was 6.8. Doc said it was 9 when I first came in for diabetes check so a marked improvement.
176108828,A Sennheiser gaming headset. The same as my friend. I recommended it for him and he bought it eventhought I have none lol
176108829,I think everyone has been quite clear.
176108830,Sounds like simulation theory or matrix theory… That’s what I have. I have learned to deal with it and accept it. I get hours of peace per day. I get the occasional hiccup and then I return back to normalcy. It will never go away completely.
176108831,"If that’s the case, then I don’t have voices. At least not with malice. When I hear it, it’s like a person spoke in my head. It’s usually word salad but one time I heard “it’s real” and “be careful what you wish for.” This never happens when I’m fully awake."
176108832,Then get positive lol.
176108833,"this link has some nice tips on things to try before trying an ad: mindbodygreen – 4 Aug 18 I'm An Integrative Psychiatrist: Here Are 9 Things I Recommend Before... 9. Opt out, say ""no,"" and make rebellious lifestyle choices."
176108834,"When doctor says I""m normal I take it to mean I’m healthy, at least about the subject at hand."
176108835,perhaps plucking those bushy eyebrows might help I think it is greyer too.
176108836,"Oh, those soumd a bit different than the other ones, who want you fit and functional- and to give up all your money to them…"
176108837,You should talk to someone about this.
176108838,"i hear of schizophrenics hallucinating noises, and seeing and hearing those things that dont exist. but do you ever hallucinate that sound is coming from an object that really isn’t? like maybe noise from a radio or TV or cellphone?"
176108839,More valuable than gold — I would never go off life happens really fast and scary without meds…
176108840,Does anyone else get thoughts/voices that are so loud you think other people can hear them? My thoughts have been so loud I feel like I am speaking them out loud and I am scared to ask anyone if I am truly saying things out loud that are meant for my head. They tried to lower my meds but .5mg. I guess that wasn’t such a good idea.
176108841,That is a hypothesis is quantum physics too! But it may also be the early warning signs of a delusion. But I guess it depends on how certain you are.
176108842,It looks like streetlights reflecting in a puddle. Very urban
176108843,Keep taking your meds.
176108844,Thank you for being so nice! Appreciated _AT_MENTION_
176108845,I don’t see it as a problem. Other people watch tv or read a book or play video games. From the morning till 6pm. Don’t worry.
176108846,Maybe try discussing your struggles with your psychiatrist or therapist instead of the help line
176108847,cheers…1515151
176108848,Congrats! It’s normal to be scared at first. I bet you do fine.
176108849,"I was told by my therapist that I have a “shattered world view.” Apparently that is a controversial term in psychology, but it does kind of fit me. I hate this place (this reality) and I’d like things and people to quit failing me. I’ve lost so much, so many important figures in my life are gone, and it’s left me devastated. I can hardly function. I quit working a few months ago, and am nowhere near going back. Of course, the finances took a dump after that, so dealing with that too. It’s subsequently left me looking at the world as a giant death trap and an abyss. Something seems off here, and I don’t know what it is. Folks talking about solipsism and nihilism got me a bit riled up, and now I can’t sleep and am deep in philosophy this evening (morning?)."
174369671,I wake up during the night and get up for 15min at 7am and then sleep again until 9-10am. I can’t sleep one shot since I had schizophrenia.
176108850,"Not that I was ever ill, but still, it’s nice to welcome back my old sceptical, rationalist self."
176108851,I think that my sister is afraid of her responsibilities should I go “nuts” since she is my only close relative.
176108852,"How does it work, how come some antipsychotic like lurasidone have generics despite their parents not expiring yet?"
176108853,My pdoc says sz causes mental decline
176108854,"Thank you! Me too! I really didn’t know that there was better living out there. I never said anything before that increase, i was scared to change anything. But once i did, my life improved like 100% but it’s still a process i see. My doc says that therapy will help too."
174369669,"Neurons are like Muppets, you can use them but if you don’t no one wants to see you"
176108855,Mr Mark _NAME_
176108856,Big extrovert here! Isolation is just about the worst thing in the world for me
176108857,Doctors withhold truth and lie my doctor told me depakote doesn’t cause weight gain and hair loss that lithium doesn’t cause hair loss and when I had a seizure during Ativan withdrawals he refused to say it was a seizure on a document for the dmv. Of course they would lie about a diagnosis. They do whatever they want.
176108858,"I just have an innokin “kromar” with a sub-ohm tank - and vape liqourice 16mg nicotine. Im puffing on it constantly so usually have to charge it twice a day, i dont like to leave it on over night."
176108859,Yeah this is what I was talking about. I wouldn’t ever be violent again

176108862,Call me naive but I’m still waiting for a new miracle med to come out. I might be waiting forever.
176108863,"They’re probably working better than you think. I felt the same way about my anxiety meds until I quit them and realized how much they actually help. I’d talk to my pdoc before quitting any meds, It could cause horrible withdrawal symptoms."
176108864,Note to Self #1 .) Don’t Say Anything.
176108865,_PERSON_ I know the feeling. Honestly the times I was in the hospital were the worse times of my life. Glad you were able to leave when you needed to.
176108866,"I want to cook a steak now I am living on my own again, have not done it in a long time."
174369678,"Yeah, and my negative symptoms disappeared on 5 mg. I think my first doctor wanted to increase my antipsychotics in order for me to get better of negative symptoms, but just decreasing them worked. I just can’t understand why my first psychiatrist didn’t consider NIDS even after I reported having negative symptoms just after taking antipsychotics (this was a central theme during my treatment). I reported it to my psychologist too, but here in Brazil psychologists don’t have to know about medicines and their side-effects."
176108867,I really not that fussed about it. I find all girls attractive so as long as she is a decent person and we get along I am fine with it.
176108868,i don’t know =/
176108869,"I’m sure it isn’t easy. When was the last time you saw them? And yes, keep Christmas in mind! I can totally see why you’d want to make it extra special, and would shrug off other holidays, you’re going to have your kids, that’s a gift in itself."
174369682,"Im sorry for your loss That’s a good reason to hate invega. I would like to try geodon, but I think the doc thinks it’s not as an effective drug as perphenazine. Have you ever been on geodon alone?"
176108870,Its delusional when you dont believe medical evidence that says you’re okay but you believe it still. Anxiety would be you’re anxious you have it or that they missed something. I get both so I know how grey area it is
176108871,In the morning I am volunteering and giving some basmati rice I made for a friend. Afterwards I am meeting another friend and going out to eat and maybe getting our nails done. I hope we have a good time.
176108872,But how to know for sure?
176108873,Thanks for the advice !!
176108874,"Good advice. They’re so hard to ignore, but, you’re right, if I try to stay emotionally flat, it should be easier. I’ll try upping my dose of meds too."
176108875,I try to get along with people in real life and avoid arguments even if I’m “right”. This is a 180 degree turn from 10 years ago.
176108876,"everyday is a struggle , to take or not to take, at the end i lived them on my plate. Many people in my mind , what ‘s between us is not a lie and i loved the time."
176108877,After my breakdown I lost contact with my best friend and for next few years only had one friend. When I was in remission I made a few elderly friends at church. My social life was church. When I became Muslim in 2011 I made several friends but since relapse I didn’t contact them much and hardly ever saw them. Over these last few years I withdrew from social life. My husband and mother and sister are my social life and I’m ok with that. I’ve always preferred solitude anyway so I’m not so interested in socialising.
176108878,That’s because some of the ingredients are likely to be dangerous stimulants. I’ve spoken to my cardiologist about these products and he says many of them cause permanent damage to your heart.
176108879,it’s just fear of anxiety playing with you…I beat my panic disorder by fighting the fear and telling myself “so what if I have a panic attack?” and once I really believed that by saying it over and over I beat the anxiety for good…it’s not easily done but keep trying to fight the fear…you can beat this.
176108880,"So far I picked up a few things from the store for dinner, prepped some dough to make fry bread, and watched an a quick lecture for my writing course. Oh I was also able to squeeze in some Netflix time. Tomorrow: I have to pay off some bills and go to work. Nothing crazy. I want to knit and study after but I’m usually tired when I come home. If not, I’ll spend the evening surfing the internet and listening to music."
176108881,What should I do? I told my psychiatrist and he said “we’ll see”
176108882,That’s a good idea to take a picture of it. There was a _NAME_ parked outside of my house the night before I got put in the hospital the first time. I assume it was real. I thought they were watching me too. It didn’t help that one of my neighbors named their WIFI network FBI surveillance _NAME_ number 5.
176108883,That’s their standard procedure
176108884,"My dad gave up alcohol a number of years ago now. Moved to sugar. We have chocolate, pastries and lollies readily available. My dad keeps a lolly jar that is usually full. All the kids love coming here but it’s hard to avoid so feeling your pain…Since giving up cigarettes I’ve found that a chocolate goes so well with coffee. I used to have a smoke and a coffee now it’s choc’s."
176108885,"I think i could possibly become a therapist. My reasoning is because, as a nurse, i already do provide therapy for our old folk. Think of it as baby psychology."
176108886,Any idea how to decrease the size of a pot belly back to a normal size? what causes a pot belly and what can i do about it?
176108887,"I was going absolutely crazy w anxiety. I was in danger of failing a class if I didn’t pass my final but I did and I am so relieved!! This semester has been a beast to deal with. Today is my last clinical day (I’ll be in the NICU again) and I will be thrilled to have my weekends back. Emotionally and mentally I’ve been hanging in there. No mental illness stuff, just plain old burnout and stress. My little brother is still trying to get stable on meds and has been going to therapy (though apparently my mom has been hijacking it-I told her she needs to make her own appts) so I am happy for him and hope he does well on his journey to recovery. I basically live at my boyfriend’s house now. Which is a little weird because his mom is here, but she works and has her own boyfriend whose place she stays at so we get tons of privacy. And it helps that she is a wonderful sweet lady who is always very nice to me and likes me. I’m so glad when my boyfriend and I get married that I’ll have her for a 
mother in law after all the horror stories I’ve heard. Anyways yeah in short things are looking good and going well with me! I’ve not been on the forum really lately so I’m gonna take some time to catch up w the posts on here."
176108888,"nice topic 1997-2002 pre-sz prodromal stage, working, withdrawing, 2002-2009 worst years, hospitalized, symptomatic, paranoia, delusions, negatives, side effects, i met my ex gf though so that was a good thing and she supported me. 2010-2019 best years so far, better med, went to college, got driving license, started clubhouse. my ex died recently and so did my dad though."
176108889,"I got side effect from a single dose (40 mg). I felt like people are listening to me closely, they checking my tone of voice, what I say etc. Its like a heightened state of anxiety. Due to this I can’t speak freely, my pitch of voice so low and almost like afraid to speak. May be I experienced that before when ask to speak in front of people on stage etc. But here it occurred with no such incident just this medicine induced it. This drug is like calling anxiety for me."
176108890,_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_._PERSON_ my husband has the powder. I’m going to take it now.
176108891,"This will probably end in a meltdown. You don’t know ????, kid. You ain’t enlightened, just crazy."
176108892,"I think it’s a lot about stress management, mentally, physically, emotionally."
176108893,Agree. Im a cleaner. But its Harder when i dont have education
176108894,She always said:”I am so regret why I choose/marry you”.I think this sentence came out of her mouth more then 10 times in the past 3 month
176108895,"Are you talking about me, _AT_MENTION_? If you still have a problem with me you can PM me instead of doing this whole thing."
176108896,"Condolences, we do seem to drop out of condition quickly when we’re inactive."
176108897,I don’t have this but it sounds like OCD intrusive thoughts.
176108898,"It’s been used waaaaay too much here in the states. Its used as a derogatory term for people who are “overly sensitive,” the irony being that people who call others snowflakes are the most sensitive people out there. Snowflake is usually meant as an insult to those who lean left. It’s common in the states to say “liberal snowflake.”"
176108899,You can always unfriend your work colleague and just explain to her that you prefer keeping your professional life separate. Then you can make your profile unsearchable so none of your other colleagues can see you.
176108900,That’s a good point _AT_MENTION_ . I count calories and I think I let myself get too hungry during the day only to then eat a larger dinner. It’s probably from a sugar drop during the day. I’ll have to try your method of just eating healthy foods and see what happens. I usually do eat healthy though. I don’t eat much ice cream or chips or anything like that.
176108901,You mean high by drugs?
176108902,So am I. I’ve never heard such stupid trivial bs. I really think they’re stupid people trying to control everyone.
176108903,I got high CBD hemp flower and smoked it so unsure of the dose

176108907,"If I do anything wrong, they’re going to kidnap me and torture me. That’s why I care. They thought I was a CIA agent. But they now know I’m not. Now they’re wondering if I work for another government. So if I mess up they’ll come after me. I don’t know what exactly would cause them to do it so I’m freaked out"
176108908,"Two years, maybe more. These people are experts and listen to what’s going on in my apartment. Usually every night I sit on my couch and check my bank account, check my email, check here and check YouTube. Apparently this threatens them so they take their craziness out on me. I almost got kicked out for retaliating. I had the cops called on me once too. I can’t bang on the walls anymore or cuss them out."
174369688,"Thanks, ive been sleeping almost 24/7… It’s the only thing that brings temporary relief. But now,when I wake up, she’s there judging me on my dreams and saying im disgusting for what I dreamed about, etc. I’ve been on the Latuda for a few months, always with food. I feel like I might need to try something else. Abilify didn’t work for me either. Thank you all who took the time to answer, I really appreciate it. I keep thinking there will be an end in sight, but then I realize there probably will never be an end…"
176108909,lol! Was the drill gun stolen from your house or your workshop?

174369684,"I recently discovered that what I assumed were negative symptoms of sza were really just signs of depression in my case. I thought it was negative symptoms because I didn’t think I was in a sad mood. But after I moved in with my partner, I suddenly became much happier than I was before and my negative symptoms for the most part, went away."
176108912,Proctor for a testing company? just observe people for cheating while they take various tests.
176108913,No delivery options. We are all in mandatory quarantine.
176108914,"Yes very much, but the med took it away."
176108915,"You can do everything you did before if try. Its true you not feel so to do nor get any pleasure from it but its possible to do. We need to make use of schedules, habit etc to do so. Thoughts like whats the point in doing so etc come but simply stick with the schedule, habit. As a first step try bathing at least once every two days. Do this for two weeks, no need to think any further. Now set a goal to do it for two weeks. Firstly we need to develop the habit and after that habit helps us to do it."

176108925,"I think you should take a legit IQ test if you really want to know your IQ. I highly doubt the one you took was reliable. That said, I think a lot of what’s in an IQ test can be learned. I score high on IQ tests, but it’s ridiculous to me because of how much of the test I learned in school. Plus, there are different types of IQ. You may have high business IQ, high emotional intelligence, etc. the standard IQ test measure logic. That’s just one measurement. And, with my high IQ, I’ve accomplished nothing. So don’t feel bad."

174369692,"As some of you know, I’m starting to taper off risperidone; it has helped me but it’s also played a part in my gaining a substantial amount of weight in the two years I’ve been on it and as I’m no longer experiencing positive symptoms I thought I’d see how I get on without it. I was venting to my friend the other day after receiving some bad health news related to my weight and we got to talking about risperidone. Now, neither of us has a degree in psychiatry, but she brought up how her friend gained weight on the drug and said friend’s research on it led to her discovering that it’s sometimes given to anorexics to help stimulate their appetite so they’ll eat more and gain weight. I was underweight at the time of admission to the psych hospital where I was first given risperidone, and I’m pretty sure some of my delusions at the time were about people discovering what I’m certain was an unspecified eating disorder I was struggling with at the time - I was barely eating and overdo
ing it with physical work at work on purpose in order to burn more calories. I’m curious if I was given risperidone specifically and not a more weight neutral drug because I was so thin at the time. My friend suggested I call my doctor/nurse practitioner for my medical records so I can see if I was ever formally diagnosed with an eating disorder. This doesn’t really change anything, I guess; just something I’ve been wondering about ever since the matter was brought up. Thanks for reading."

There are many mistakes For example, everyone of you using the name ""schizophrenic ’ to describe the characteristics of the person with sz ,and this mistake you must using the word "" schizophrened "" instead like depressed ,because the person in the position of affected not in the position of develop the sz or its symptoms (not actor )"

174369702,"Nearly 20 years ago I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. I was in an extremely stressful situation, and started hearing voices. After starting anti-psychotics and antidepressants the voices went away and my mood somewhat improved. After a year or so, under a pdoc’s supervision, I tried to go off APs. I had a relapse within a few weeks. I later asked a pdoc if he thought it might be psychotic depression, and I think (it’s been a few years) he said something about the timing of my symptoms. In recent weeks I’ve had two separate therapists express doubts about this diagnosis. They’ve said that they think I’m too in touch with reality to be Sz/SzA. Is there any way to be sure if I have either illness? Could I be better now, 20 years later? Could it have been something else (psychotic depression, “brief psychotic disorder”, etc?)"

I don’t really remember leaving my house.

Why do my doctors, based on scientific research and clinical experience, acknowledge there IS rebound psychosis and i probably suffered from it? I and my doctors know more about what i experienced than a random stranger on the internet. And why then, do people (including me) who were prescribed AP without ever having suffered psychosis, suddenly get psychotic in withdrawal? And why is cold turkey quitting more difficult than slow tapering? There is simply scientific knowledge that the brain is damaged and sort of overcompensates due to medication use. Read the scientific literature if you dont believe me. If you want to take the broken leg example…the leg can be more weak after removing a cast.

176109002,"Yes, I didn’t get it the first time and needed a lawyer too. There are people here who go to college and get disability and it helps pay the bills. I don’t think mild cognitive disability will stop you from working. Even if you decide never to work, it’s still possible to lead a productive life through friends, community groups, volunteering, helping your parents out with work,etc. I am learning to live a fulfilling life relying on disability though I intend to try working again soon. Quality of life is important for the mentally ill, especially when we have a busy schedule. I recommend an outpatient treatment program and support group to go to. There are lots of young people and I even made close friends."
176109003,"Got in an argument with the roommate last night who happens to be a woman. She’s gone a lot and sometimes leaves in the morning and doesn’t come back until after 8:00 pm. Best roommate I ever had. I try to go out even when I don’t feel like it so she can have the apartment to herself. Most roommates like that. And I left last night at 8:30 pm so she can come home to an empty apartment. I know I like that and I figured she’s just like me. I left for an hour but when I got back she still wasn’t home. I went to my room to go to bed early and shortly I heard her come home. Fine. I was minding my own business and our rooms share a wall. She has a habit of muttering to herself which is fine. But I heard two extremely loud thumps from her room. I mean LOUD. I got up to investigate what they were. It was late and to be honest I was wondering if I should be scared or threatened. I poked my head out of room and asked what happened. And she said nothing happened. Then out of the blue she told me I h
ad left all the lights on with no one home last week. Fine. But she said it belligerently and disrespectfully. I said OK but told her I had a few complaints about her too. She says back rudely, “I don’t give a damn about your complaints.” I forget what else she said but we said some mean things back and forth and it got pretty loud. And I said something personal about her being homeless for years. That really got to her. I regret it today because I have empathy for the homeless and I knew a bunch of them at my last place. But it was satisfying because she just gave back some weak retort. Then I yelled something and I guess the argument was over but she said she would call 911 on me if I got violent. I told her I had not been violent in 30 years and went to bed and I could hear her muttering next door for another half hour. I have little sympathy for her because it’s obvious she has a low opinion of me. She shouldn’t have moved in. In the interview with the counselor we started off great but halfway 
through I could tell both of us had misgivings. But I thought it could work. It’s both our faults, we shouldn’t be sharing this apartment. She has a strong personality and I read people wrong a lot of times but I knew she would pull something and give me a hard time, And she did. Our first house meeting with the counselor she immediately attacked me and I defended myself well but she is just a difficult person and she was homeless for 14 years and I think it messed her up psychologically. Having a strong personality is fine but don’t use it to take advantage of people or bully someone which I think she will do. So I’m glad I made her feel bad. The epilogue is that I got home from my sisters at 8:30 pm and now it’s past 11:00 pm and she is not home and has never stayed out this late. And I just noticed half an hour ago that a lot of cleaning supplies of hers in the kitchen and bathroom are gone. _PERSON_ what the hell that means; my first reaction was being shocked. I thought, ""Man, did she move out
.? But I looked in the hall closet and it is still full of her stuff. I don’t think she is moving out but it’s weird that she is out so late and all this stuff is missing."

176109006,"I’m just in pain right now because I don’t feel like I’m going to get the support I want/need. So it feels like I’m going to have to figure out all this crap by myself for myself. I want to believe that the next date they’ll be more supportive and might understand why I’m in pain, but that feels like asking too much. I really see so much of my family and so much of the world now as like ‘hurt children’ acting out from their pain that wasn’t resolved. And I’m not really sure how to resolve or handle mine… But it maddens me more that most of our system thinks that if they just give you some drug it will make you feel better when what’s causing the pain isn’t chemicals in your brain. I mean, when they suggested I would basically be put back in my covertly abusive home, then somehow that’s going to do me any good? Problem is most people think if you’ve got a roof over your head you’re being ‘supported’. Support should FEEL like support… not like getting a two-faced 
or backhanded wad of money. Whatever the word is … There’s just a lot of immaturity in my family and my god it feels like I have to try excruciatingly hard not to cave in and yell at everyone to avoid the risk of being branded ‘crazy’ for responding to something that feels very accurate in my perception. If I could get my own space and financial support/medical support… I can foresee myself actually getting bettter. But if they send me back to this crowded, immature, negative, backstabbing family? Then, I don’t see how that’s going to work… It’s putting me in a bad place to think of the negative outcomes right now…"

If you need one of these drugs, take it, and listen to your psychiatrist. Monitor your glucose, weight, lipids and work hard to manage your diet and exercise. All drugs have side effects. This can be managed. To name a few of them…Clozaril, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Risperdal, etc. There are more. Any takers?"

176109034,"So my brother is paranoid and dealing with some persecutory delusions. He’s hearing things through walls and thinks it’s his family talking, but I know he’s hearing them in his head. I was on the phone with him for an hour and a half a week ago and he was telling me what they said as they said it, and it was obviously in his head. He’s moved in with my stepdad who isn’t the best influence, and my mom finally made it out there but he won’t visit her. He says he has bad experience with hotels, which is where she is staying. He is probably referring to when he went to a hotel last week but still heard the voices, and he claimed the hotel staff thought he was doing drugs and was planning on calling the cops on him, which is nonsense. He checked out without staying the night. I’m trying to think of any way we might be able to convince him to visit my mom or see a doctor for psychiatric evaluation. He claims he doesn’t want to be put in a straight jacket, and thinks that if he goes in peo
ple will label him “crazy.” What he doesn’t seem to understand is that you can avoid the straight jacket by seeing a psychiatrist voluntarily before things get out of hand. If you ignore the problem, a “straight jacket” is a very real possibility down the line. I can’t seem to get through to him and my mom can’t either. If he avoids my mom the whole time, her visit will have been a total waste of money. She flew out there completely to see him and get him evaluated."

176109051,"Many years ago I had just finished having a delusion (I didn’t know it was a delusion) that some “good” people had been tortured and dismembered with body parts frozen by some “bad” people that were bowling with heads across the floor of the apartment upstairs. I ran out of my apartment in horror and saw blood all over the hallway walls and then ran across the parking lot to a donut shop where I told a counter person who called the police. Rather than being beaten and cuffed when the police arrived, the cop asked for my cell phone which I had on me and checked out the apartment then cuffed me beside the police car. He then explained to me that there was no blood in the hallway and asked if he could take me to the nearest mental hospital to which I agreed. I checked myself in that night and was diagnosed and treated with a quick (3 year) recovery after keeping my horrific delusions and hallucinations secret for 11 years. What made me come to terms that I was experiencing a delusion was pos
itive community support and later at the hospital support from my family."

176109061,"How long will you be detoxing for? Could you ask your doc for the injectible form of the med this month? If you have thrown up your pills, it is a good idea to call your doc anyways to ask what you should do. Mine has always told me that if you can see the pill in the vomit, it is safe to retake, and if you can’t, it already got absorbed. But that is for my med and my body. Your doctor might have different advice for you."
174369733,I think it’s time to change your psychiatrist. You don’t need injections to help although many function well with them. Oral antipsychotics can help too and you could tweek the doses to as low as you can go. Stopping all meds is problematic and not recommended. I’d suggest getting a doctor who’ll listen to you.

174369753,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Cariprazine Safety in Adolescents and the Elderly: Analyses of Clinical Study Data. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, I _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in psychiatry, 2020 Schizophrenia is a life-long mental disorder, affecting young adolescents to elderly patients. Antipsychotic treatment is indicated for all patients with schizophrenia, including the very young and old as well. Developmental issues in the young and decline in organ functioning in the elderly could influence reactions to the drug, and require different dosing regimens. The aim of the present article was to examine the safety profile and dosing requirements in adolescent (13 to less than 18) and elderly (65 and above) patients treated with cariprazine. Data from two clinical studies (one pharmacokinetic pediatric study and one phase III clinical trial) on 49 adolescent patients and 17 elderly patients (65 years of age or above) treated with cariprazine was examined. Safety measures includ
ed assessment of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory values, physical examinations, extrapyramidal symptom (EPS)-, depression-, and suicidality rating scales. Safety parameters were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results indicate that cariprazine was generally safe and well tolerated. Adverse events in the marginal age populations were comparable to the adult population, except for less insomnia in the young and no reports of akathisia in the elderly. Laboratory parameters, vital sign values and EEG parameters were comparable to previously published data in the adult population. In conclusion, cariprazine in the approved adult dose-range of 1.5-6 mg might be a safe treatment option also in adolescent and elderly patients with schizophrenia. Further studies are need to verify these preliminary findings."

176109140,I thought I was possessed and I thought my sister went to hell. I cut my arm to turned out to be the number 7 and then thought God wanted me to cut my neck. I heard birds chirping in a weird way. Felt like different signs were everywhere. I heard neighbors calling my neighbor “_NAME_” like the devil was cursing _NAME_. My boyfriend says he is a fallen angel so I wondered if it was connected to him.

I realized that their whole ploy is to make you feel like the worst person on Earth, and any attempt of theirs to befriend you is to manipulate you to that end. Notice how schizophrenics always think they are like the devil or the beast, it’s because of the voices’ manipulation. Don’t befriend the voices, do what you can to treat the schizophrenic symptoms fully. Don’t give them a ??????? inch. Not even a millimeter. You are at war with those symptoms. You need to liberate your innocent, true self from them. Don’t succumb to their siren song! There are plenty of people in the real world who will be your friend, you don’t need the voices. They are abusive pieces of sh-t anyways."

Typically I consent to do these things in the dreams because I feel an uncontrollable, powerful desire for the demons in the dreams. Then I wake up and feel ashamed.

176109211,"_AT_MENTION_, The vast majority of my psychosis was very traumatic to me so, I don’t remember most of it. When a person is severely abused as a kid, as I was, their psyches tend to leave their bodies and drift afloat somewhere above the scene of the trauma. As this happens, the memories of the event is lost. As I was continually abused as a youngster, I tended to use this coping method frequently during traumatic periods such as incest for example. This caused me to forget the specific situation. As I grew older, I still used this coping method of forgetfulness whenever I experienced any trauma like psychosis, for example. And that’s why I remember only bits and pieces of my psychotic experience over my lifetime. I am diagnosed sza."

So my plan is to completely ignore those voices and the situation they put my mind in.

176109268,"I don’t know. Here’s the whole thing from webmd on niacin side effects : Side Effects & Safety Niacin is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth. A common minor side effect of niacin is a flushing reaction. This might cause burning, tingling, itching, and redness of the face, arms, and chest, as well as headaches. Starting with small doses of niacin and taking 325 mg of aspirin before each dose of niacin will help reduce the flushing reaction. Usually, this reaction goes away as the body gets used to the medication. Alcohol can make the flushing reaction worse. Avoid large amounts of alcohol while taking niacin. Other minor side effects of niacin are stomach upset, intestinal gas, dizziness, pain in the mouth, and other problems. When doses of over 3 grams per day of niacin are taken, more serious side effects can happen. These include liver problems, gout, ulcers of the digestive tract, loss of vision, high blood sugar, irregular heartbeat, and other serious problems. When used daily f
or multiple years, niacin might increase the risk of developing diabetes. Some concern has been raised about stroke risk in people taking niacin. In one large study, people who took high doses of niacin had a two-fold greater risk of stroke compared to those not taking niacin. However, it is unlikely that this outcome was due to niacin. Most experts believe that it is too soon to draw any conclusions about niacin and strokes. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Niacin is LIKELY SAFE for pregnant and breast-feeding women when taken in the recommended amounts. The recommended amount of niacin for pregnant or breast-feeding women is 30 mg per day for women under 18 years of age, and 35 mg for women over 18. Allergies : Niacin might worsen allergies by causing histamine, the chemical responsible for allergic symptoms, to be released. Heart disease/unstable angina : Large amounts of niacin can increase the risk of irregular heartbeat. Use with caution. Crohn’s disease : People with Cro
hn’s disease might have low niacin levels and require supplementation during flare-ups. Diabetes : Niacin might increase blood sugar. People with diabetes who take niacin should check their blood sugar carefully. Gallbladder disease : Niacin might make gallbladder disease worse. Gout : Large amounts of niacin might bring on gout. Kidney disease : Niacin might accumulate in people with kidney disease. This might cause harm. Liver disease : Niacin might increase liver damage. Don’t use large amounts if you have liver disease. Stomach or intestinal ulcers : Niacin might make ulcers worse. Don’t use large amounts if you have ulcers. Very low blood pressure : Niacin might lower blood pressure and worsen this condition. Surgery : Niacin might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking niacin at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. Fatty deposits around tendons (tendon xanthomas) : Niacin might increase the risk of infections in xanthomas. Thyroid disorders : Thyroxine is a h
ormone produced by the thyroid gland. Niacin might lower blood levels of thyroxine. This might worsen symptoms of certain thyroid disorders."

176109310,"I don’t know if others can do what I did. What I can tell you is that when I was first DXed around 93/94, there were no positive examples of recovery for anyone to point to for me. I’d go to the horrible local meetings and their best example of “recovery” was the guy who was so drugged he was just sort of leaned into a corner of the room so he wouldn’t topple over. They considered “so drugged he’s no longer bothering us” as “recovered”. That wasn’t for me. Obviously not all of us are going to achieve neurotypical level of functioning in recovery, but I’d like for those who can to have hope that it’s possible and to not give up and waste their lives like I was encouraged to do when I was first diagnosed. “Don’t try, you’re not going to be able to do that.” “You have unrealistic expectations.” “You’re just going to make yourself sicker.” Bullcrap. The best advice I can give is to not let someone else tell you what your limits are, find out for yourself. And 
don’t just try once and give up, if you bounce hard enough off a wall enough times you might just move it or break through. Give recovery your very best effort before giving up. My 2 cents as the person who has done all of the things my first psychiatrists said I couldn’t."

I would give some to charity and I would open a animal sanctuary. I would get more tattoos and not have to save up for each one. I would fly first class and sleep in my own cabin. I would maybe go on holidays all over the world. I would offer my x money to take me back. Or find someone who cares about the environment n animals. I would get driving lessons to become more independent. I would do a lot for the environment and for animals. I would help out loved ones if they needed it as such. Buy a place in the country side in Sweden and let my friend live there for free if he maintains it and let’s me stay there when I come on holidays. I’m so grateful for e
verything I have and I say thank you regularly for all I have but to afford things like that without having to save up for it etc would be fun. I will never afford to buy a house now.

I would buy a place where I used to live in the country side in sa. Or move back with my x if he would have me. I would buy realestate and maybe live a bit here and visit often there.

176109404,"I have problem with holding things in mind while doing activity, thinking etc. For example If I do some activity, think of some thing etc I quickly forget about what I did before, what needed to do next (immediate goal) and thus forget about every other thought, tasks to do etc. Mind is blank with no thoughts running as if I do one thing I forget about every other thing at the moment even no sense of time, surroundings etc. OCD issues also due to this. For example when I wash hands suddenly a thought comes that I not washed properly and I get so absorbed in that thought and I am not sure if I cleaned properly as I forgot about what I did before clearly. Then repeats washing then some other doubt or some distraction comes and then again washing and so on… Finally I am forced to stop after lot of struggle. Due to poor working memory. If some distractions come it disrupts the main activity, and thus quickly gets bored. Forget about daily goals, time etc. Simple tasks times lot of time to finish due 
to this poor distraction ignoring ability. Anyone else have similar kind of problems? Thanks"

174369838,ok _AT_MENTION_ I’m sorry. You asked “Why” and I meant to give you an answer from what I knew. I did not mean to be mean. Only I thought you could get through to yourself and I guess you can’t. Can you change doctors?
176109477,"A job is incredibly empowering. I would encourage you to either go to school to study in a field or like or find a job, even just volunteer work. Slow, baby steps to grow back your confidence. Eventually, you might be able to do great things. A passion in something you like, a cause you can dedicate yourself to. I am dedicating my life to law and am applying to law school now."
176109478,"People hate people with Sz - cos frankly they are ignorant. Yet if they bothered to do a cursory google search they would find out we are no more violent than the general population. There is a rare odd 2-3% of Sz’s that commit serious crimes - but you will usually find that alcohol and drug addiction is a co-morbid factor in it as well. No more than the rest of the population. The media certainly dont help. But its just something i personally have grown to live with. Not everybody judges you - i have a couple of mates that consider me a vulnerable adult and actually support me. Its the alcoholics in the bars - that think they know better that have judged me, whilst they are merrily shagging about and beating their wifes when they have had a skinfull."

174369835,"At my early stages of schizophrenia, just cause I felt that my car and other things attache me to materialism and cause lack of concentration on my studies I had to either give them away or through in the trash. Expensive things literally expensive things. It was like an obsession I Couldn’t resist. But that was in the past. Now, after five years since that happened I got the same feeling again it is like delete all the softwares you bought inside your laptop because you feel like. What! Why. I want to know if anyone has this in common?"
174369842,"I misused supplements that were technically legal 5 years ago. However I was taking too many of them in a attempt to deal with psychosis, insomnia, and anxiety. I did not OD thankfully but it got me to the Psych Ward. I quit the supplements cold turkey and dried out in my apartment by playing jazz for several days and nights and finding I could sleep a little. I then decided to do what the doctors told me and accept less sleep as a norm rather than a disaster and stop fearing death from exhaustion. I didn’t answer the status of my psychosis because my voices are relatively quiet but my negative symptoms are very bad and I am stuck in a group home watching the World pass me by."

176109504,"I only have 19 tablets left, should I take one? Maybe I weened off too quickly."
176109505,What do you mean. Meds correct. There’s no inspiration.
176109506,Give the Clozapine a shot. I took 600 mg. daily and that’s the reason why I couldn’t tolerate it. Not every one gets the sideeffects and you can only find out if you can tolerate it by trying it for half a year. After that period you and your doctor can discuss about the advantages and disadvantages. Who knows maybe it could become your happy pill.
174369840,_AT_MENTION_ yes I think I’ve tried a whole bunch. Clozapine works the best

176109508,"I quit dairy, ate next to none of it for a while. Nearly all my stomach problems disappeared, and some fatigue and mental health issues (mood, pms) seemed to get better too. Today had loads of it again - milk, yoghurt, spaghetti carbonara. I love it! But now im punished, my stomach is troubling me again majorly and i feel bad. I think i need to quit. Several in my family have issues with it. I want to get tested. Did anyone quit dairy products and what was the effect?"
176109509,"Well, IMO the meds, no matter what you take, does not take your problems away but helps you cope with the problems instead - I’ve also had issues finding something that works for me - my best advice is to engage in something soothing, like a coloring book, music, movies, anything that keeps you from listening to voices and is calming Hope this helps."

I’m sorry you spend less time with your doctor now. I would like more time with mine, too, but it’s expensive. I definitely think talk therapy should be used more.

I feel fine other than being tired from lack of sleep, but apparently, things are pretty bad because my mom called my doctor yesterday morning. I’m not sure what’s going on or what’s going to happen. My mom was saying that I might have to go to the hospital again. I just hope I do’t have to. No, not until my mom told me. Thanks Gratitude. I know that I always say and think that I’m a bad person, but the rational part of me is pretty sure that I’m not. It’s just that “pretty sure” isn’t really good enough for me. And like, to me, I think that the feeling of being a bad person is more of a guilty feeling than a shameful one.

I been there, a lot of my so called “friends” left me when I was in need or they no longer needed me, just like that disposable. Right now I only have 4 friends and I manage to keep this relationship by hearing them and sharing back, because friends are there to hear you out. I rarely hang out but when I do we have fun, I also try to understand their point of view but defend my own and respectfully disagree. These are just some things I have done to keep my friendship. But don’t fall for people who just want to take, those aren’t friends at all."

176109580,"As far as metabolism is concerned diet is a huge factor. If you look at the biochemistry and what happens when you eat an overabundance of carbs you’ll see why they create triglycerides that have to go into fat storage. Your fat cells, however might be full, and you might be having trouble generating new ones. Adipocite hypertrophy. There’s an overflow, so triglycerides linger longer. That’s also the reason for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. When your fat storage is full, the liver can’t export the fat and it accumulates there."

174369872,"Do you know about trial work periods yet? I don’t really think there is a set length of time to go back to work that covers everybody. Each person experiences schizophrenia differently, with different degrees of severity. And each person recovers at a different pace. Using myself as an example I spent 8 months locked up in the psychiatric hospital when I was 21. I got out and 9 months later I got a job. It may take you a longer or shorter amount of time to be employed. A trial work period is a way for someone to test the waters and try working and see how much you can handle. You can try working full time or part time and still receive benefits and if you find after 6 months or 9 months that you are comfortable with working then maybe try getting off SSDI. If you try working and going off SSDI, I believe (but I’m not sure) that for half a year or so, Social Security will keep your case “on their books” so if you suddenly can’t work or things go bad you can immediately get back on SSDI wit
hout having to go through the whole process of reapplying and filing a new claim. You could double-check this with Social Security."

They wanted at least two years of accounts receivable experience including collections, and I have four years, but it’s not medical billing related. If they’re willing to train me on submitting claims, I am willing to be loyal and stay there. By the way, the work I did yesterday was just sorting patient records according to the assisted living communities where they live, so the case managers can take the records there. The office manager said it takes her about four hours to do, because she sits at the front desk with constant interruptions. I had the luxury of sitting in someone’s office so I could spread out and make it easier. I made a commitment to come every other Friday (after their big interdisciplinary meetings) to do that job for her. I love to sort things, so I enjoyed it!"

176109606,"I went food shopping early this morning. I didn’t get a lot but I found some great deals at Safeway. Tuna was on sale for 50 cents a can but I had to buy 24 to get the deal. It’s worth it. I bought some vegetables too, and a few other things. The store is ten minutes from my apartment. Some of you know I’m having trouble with a neighbor. Well, I walked out of the store to my car and on my way out I saw some guy standing about 15 feet away. I glanced over once and then I kept walking but I glanced again and it was the neighbor. I’ve felt hatred and dislike towards the guy but maybe because I was tired or maybe I was still feeling the effects of all the crack, heroin, and pot I used 29 years ago or maybe my resperidone temporarily stopped working but I didn’t glare at him and in fact after a couple of seconds of looking at each other we both greeted each other. And he said something semi-friendly and I answered back somewhat friendly and he walked over and we just started talking. We just m
ade some small talk and I had gone to his door a couple of nights ago at 12:00 am to ask him to leave me alone and we had settled our difference somewhat and so when he asked me for a ride home I said sure why not. And we talked and he was really friendly and we discussed people in the complex and other things and he told me to come up anytime. I was relieved and he went upstairs to his apartment and I brought my groceries in and got something to drink and I got online and was surfing the web. About 15 minutes ago I must of bugged him because directly above me I heard an extremely loud, violent thump on my ceiling. I just thought, WTH? And I sat there thinking and then I got mad which was a stupid mistake. I think he sensed it and he started laughing because we has just got along 15 minutes before and so he thumped again. Crap. I think all that good will went down the drain. I might have to wait another six months to get along. It could be another 6 months before we get along again. Crap."

If he is dum as he acts, then start seeing the insane $hit that you can get away with. Ask for a wireless phone(some places actually have these[ say that the ones on the unit are never available], Ask for double meals(You didn’t eat alot/feel malnourished, or you were losing weight)as well as whatever else you can do. Ask for whatever amenities you can get, because, honestly, fck this guy. I had a pdoc that was just like this guy that you were talking about, and with these kind of people, your negotiation skills will go up tremendously. But he needs to be in jail above all 
else. I would get out of there as soon as possible, unless you think that the meds he is giving you(I think this is honestly medical, and could be toxoplasmosis, but fck, what would he know about that, either.) are helping/already taking the symptoms away. To sum it all up, he kept me there, longer than almost everybody else, and I became a total douche, asking for snacks from different nurses, negotiating the lowest medicine possible, while having to take random deals(sure dum@ss but fck you) and occasionally, he tried to yell and project his narcissism. He must know his exam room pretty well, because sometimes I would go near deaf when he started. I gave him the same ???? back(usually retaliatory, but sometimes when he was feeling peaceful[because fck that guy] . I made sure there wasn’t as much air in the room as I was opening(entering the room) and closing the door as to not make him go deaf. On the way out I would accidentally slam the door just loud enough that for some reason, the sound was loud enou
gh really only bother him. If the nurses were bad, I would ask them innocent condescending questions about why they wouldn’t know something(their job really is notoriously easy) hence embarrassing them, and making them look abysmal in front of everyone. If another person who was staff was just like them, I would just involve other people, making the original nurse feel even worse about herself, feel completely stupid, while the other patients were just still giving them $hit. Long story short, do what you can and get what you can from these people. If they act off, let an appropriate amount of people (coherent, non-narcissistic patients) know and they will start them endless amounts of ????. It’s funny, but that’s how things can go your way in this type of situation. Extended sick leaves were taken as well as many vacation days. Some people got beat the fck up, while others, occasionally collateral-acting(they had their share of douche moments and hid in the back office) were sent to a hospital. Some pe
ople(eventually even staff supposedly)went to jail(because for some reason, they didn’t look ‘reactive’, or couldn’t keep a cooler head when security(who was even jumped, at least initially, lol) eventually showed up(if they did). They even told the staff at certain times, that they would have to fend for themselves, or even start behaving(yes, that actually had to come out) I played good guy after that and we got alot of snacks and drinks in return, at least. The only people who would never get it were the sadists(yes, there are sadists that work in the mental health industry) and we had to call attorneys( who threatened lawsuits and criminal charges) just to get them to fck off. I never really went to groups, because I already knew just about everything about psychology.(most of it is just common sense, unless your just curious about certain people and supposed mental health conditions that are just rare, or/and are questionably caused by medical conditions, making psychiatry look completely irrelev
ant in terms of treatment). It really is up to you what you want to do about this, but your best is to look up personality disorders and even _PERSON_ I types like the different types of Schizophrenia, Mania, and Bipolar disorder(even the older ones that are not even in the current DSM[Diagostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, I believe is what is called] . Sadism(of all things was taken out, and Borderline was just added in the previous one. Sh*t’s scary if you think about it.

Sadism is real and active in many places, even in schools(though it’s mostly student’s that just happen to be required, at least by their parents and/or ego of not looking stupid, having friends). Sociopathic and Psychopathic Disorder, are now 'Anti-Social Personality Disorder, but people know that this is bs and these people, while similar in their lack o
f empathy, really can act different in alot of ways. Sociopaths tend to act impulsively, and can be friendly(depending on their comfort zone and how they were raised) while Psychopaths can vary quite a bit. They tend to be cold, calculating, and callous, while gaslighting you every chance they get. They also live a parasitic lifestyle taking easy jobs, and living with people for as long as they can to avoid paying rent and while contributing as little/if at all as they can. They avoid work, even when given breaks, and are just a pain in the _AT_MENTION_ to deal with as a whole. If you have anymore questions about how to deal with these types of people, and/or to deal with being in a psych unit, then feel free to hit me up. Good luck out there."
174369902,"I kept 2 friends from school, my best from 2nd grade on, so since 1991. And the guy I call my brother and uncle to my kids, also hubby’s best friend and _NAME_ is who introduced me to _NAME_. Without _NAME_, no 20 year relationship, I’ve known _NAME_ like 2 weeks longer than _NAME_. But that’s all I kept, they knew about my sz from beginning of friendship. _NAME_, my best friend, was there when I came back from surgery and it was triggered, so she’s the one who in5th grade said hey, we’ll get thru this. I am friends with _NAME_’s coworkers more, cause I guess I make interesting company as I am not shy about being a practicing Witch, and some come to me for help with things. You all may not see it as a religion, but it is for me. I’m asked for house saging and blessings, help with paranormal ongoings as we have at one family’s house. They came to me. I didn’t offer my findings so I didn’t influence, but I had same experiences at their house that weekend before they brought it up. 
But they treat me as a person, I’m “one of the guys” cause I still go out with them when invited, like we’re all going as a group, thebhusbands and wives on Feb 16th to Red _NAME_ in _NAME_ to celebrate my bday Feb 11, Bday for couples, and _NAME_ and my’s 20 year anniversary Feb 18. No kids, just adults."
176109703,"I think there is like 3000 on the waiting list, but women and children get it first so probably more like 5000"
176109704,"I’m not religious either, but I do think some people should really think long and hard about having kids. There are a lot of people on here that are terrified of everything and can’t leave the house because of stress triggers and kids take a lot of work and their needs come first. There are still a lot of people who refuse to believe that they have delusions and will argue to the core that they are real. I think it’s more dangerous to kids when the parent thinks the delusions are real rather then coming to terms with the illness. I think it comes down to what you can actually handle. But if you’re so debilitated that your paranoia controls how you live then having children might not be the best idea. It wouldn’t be fair to put something that heavy on a child. They shouldn’t live their lives stuck in a house and not experiencing life, but again it just depends on the severity of the situation. As far as them having an illness, yes genetics come in to play but it’s not a guarantee they 
will have the illness. If it were a guarantee I would not do that to my child, but that’s me."
176109705,ah that must suck… going to sleep is the time during the day where i can let go of everything and feel relaxed… must really suck to feel scared then… sorry to hear you feeling like that. What did you therapist say about it?

You may post in a recovery sense, ie- I have a delusion god or gods talk to me OR reading religious texts bothers me. Also, this is new, typing G instead of god doesn’t get around the rules. Remember, some find religion highly triggering."
176109712,"Oh wow that?s disturbing. I would never hurt a person, but I was delusional a couple weeks ago and wanted to hurt someone, and I thought about it, felt like it was right and was actually afraid of myself for even getting close to. Luckily I haven?t ran into that situation and I think God helped me out. Plus when I got my shot, the nurse pulled up my paperwork from my therapist and asked what it was about? I realized then it sounded crazy."

176109717,_AT_MENTION_. Glad to hear it’s been a good year! I think two years ago or so the small town my mom lives in got flooded so bad it ruined a truck and a tractor not to mention would have drown a heard of cattle if the farmers hadn’t moved them to higher ground… Thank goodness the farmers round here are smart cookies
176109718,I’ve been stable for almost 2 years now and have bad days sometimes. Sometimes my depression is very bad and sometimes it less. The fact that I have to go to work is what pushes me to keep going. I think without a job I would be laying in bed all day. Don’t get me wrong I still am taking an antidepressant and my depression is almost gone but it still lingers in the background. I try to be grateful and have a list of all the things I am grateful for but some days it’s hard but I push myself. You have to do your best and if you can sleep it off which is what I do because tomorrow is going to be another day. Hang in there and hopefully this helps!!
176109719,I find stimulants help with negative symptoms _AT_MENTION_ Temporarily though. Have you considered taking a stimulant anti depressant like Welbutrin ? Cheers.

So far no more notifications, but now I’m worried she’ll be back with another account. It wasn’t even a bad comment, think she was just trolling. Either way, it scared me."

How did you come to find out about these minions? How do you know whether it’s a minion or a human harassing you? If you believe this is so real, then why haven’t you called the police?

Let me share some things I’ve learned and have been trying to tell myself. This feeling manifests in multiple ways for multiple people. Be it feeling better, convincing yourself you aren’t sick, voices telling you, etc. but it’s common. Reality check with your loved ones, ask them if they think you are sick, and trust your judgment. Also your Pdoc, ask your Pdoc, they will know. I’m waiting to see mine right now to confirm my thoughts. Write out a list, reasons why you think you are or aren’t sick. Also write down how the medications have helped you. Be it voices, delusions, whatever. You aren’t alone in this"

176109791,I love my kids so much. They keep me going. But sometimes at the end of the week with them I look forward to them going to their dad’s place for the week. I can just kind of let go of plastering a smile on my face and coping as best as I can. My week without them is sometimes cathartic. I feel really stressed that i feel that way. They are my life. I just need time to decompress.
176109792,I’m not going to say anything bad about others choices of antipsychotics so I will say that it realy helped the positives to a degree that I was free of thought disturbances and voices. And I got a damn good sleep on it. One of my friends got put on it after he had tried all of the other antipsychotics that didn’t work. And this last resort saved his life. Because of some unpleasant side effects I quit the drug 25 years ago.

I also got an inserted thought from _PERSON_ - he made me confused as to which of two mugs to use for my cappuccino just now. Was hesitating for a little while. Then he yelled out to me: psychotic b…ch!! C.nt! You think you’re so special don’t you?? Felt like I was losing control of my mind - like my brain would pour out. It was scary. Fortunately it’s ok now, it passed. But I’m still paranoid."

176109797,Another message I sent to my pdoc I want to share with you guys. Anyone relate? I just want to know how to get out of the apathy I’m in. I’m a writer but I haven’t worked on my book projects in about three months. I want to so badly but it’s like this paralysis hits me. Like I’m physically and mentally stuck and unable to begin. If I had the ability to begin I’d work well but beginning is the problem. Why is this? Do I have to force myself to begin? Or wait for a good day? These good days seem so few. Is it normal to struggle with things like working or cleaning house or going out? Does a normal person struggle with this? What is normal anyway???

174369921,I’ll eventually be able to get some control over my negative symptoms. Also my mood should be better. I’m a tad worried about weaning off my lithium that there is the possibility of going into a mania. That never turns out well. Anyway I’m hoping to sleep solid 6 hours a night for an easier day.
176109804,I highly do not recommend working overnights and going to school full time. Everyone I know who tried that ended up dropping out.
176109805,"A few things aligned in my life in a way that really motivated me to do everything I could to get better. They weren’t mostly good things. From there I just pushed myself more and more every day. It was exhausting. I started reading books, started doing my own chores and taking care of myself, working out, planning and organizing my life so I could remember to do things, being more social… basically just tried to do the opposite of all the things I was struggling with. It took a couple of years. I also had the social support and economic security that I think everyone needs if they are to get better from this illness."
176109806,I can’t play at all and I have a piano sitting in my room for over 15 years. Don’t be hard on yourself.
176109807,You ever thought of therapy to deal through these issues? Honestly. You’ve some different ideas on things you would be better working through with someone knowledgeable. Sz makes you overthink things for a lot of people. That can be detrimental to things that should be an instinctual thing for most males and females. It’s a different world these days and being secure in your sexuality really does help. I think you may be over thinking it all. It’s a pretty simple process.
176109808,Hey _USER_ID_.

176109815,Sleep is for me the most important indicator. If that gets messed up from my experience of it the balance you get erodes and you start failing to cope without sufficient rest
176109816,"Oh right, I miss read, my bad Good for you :)))"
176109817,I looked it up online and didn’t find any satisfactory answers. The best thing to do is call your doctor and let them know you’re sick and ask them what you should do. Don’t leave your house apparently. This will stop spread of the disease. I did read where you should be washing your hands plenty with soap and warm water.
176109818,2500 is definitely better than 25000 but your right it’s still a lot. Money issues is probably something you wouldn’t know upon first meeting someone. that’s where loneliness really hurts people with relationships.

176109824,"Funny, just a minute ago I was reading a study that said autistic people tend to be diagnosed with psychotic disorder-NOS more than schizophrenia"
176109826,That’s an interesting question. I wonder if you’d stay long or just a bit before going back home. You won’t know until you reach your destination though.

174369933,"I have been stable for two years psychosis wise. The doctors need to understand that I will not tolerate the levels and variety of medications I have taken willingly up until now. My aim is the minimum effective dose, and if it happens to be 0mg I am up for it I am only having mild withdrawals at the moment which is more than tolerable. Coming off the benzos has been much harder, but I am leaving them at 10mg as I have already reduced from 30mg of diazepam pd."

There’s this article here of the technology could work: https://slate.com/technology/2016/03/schizophrenia-and-subvocal-speech-why-people-with-schizophrenia-hear-the-voices-of-god-spies-and-supernatural-entities.html If they give me thoughts and then put them on microphone then maybe this is how the technology could work.

176109846,_PERSON_ do you have counselling in your country You may benefit from it seeing as you are so upset
174369936,"I think you do. You’re delusions are bizarre. I think most therapists, psychiatrists aren’t worth their salary in my case. I benefited from therapy, don’t get me wrong, but I was also harmed. It’s like a rape victim getting constantly told it never happened or it was their fault. It hurts and does more harm than good in my case. I’m pretty confident I got bipolar type 2 now. I’m learning to think for myself and I’m getting of my AP because it doesn’t do ???? for me. None of them do. I’ve tried all of them practically and almost died on Clozaril. Even shat and pissed my pants! And for what! I’ve never hallucinated in my life. My symptoms started in 1 day 9 years ago and have improved considerably. My DP/DR was worse than my alleged schizophrenia. And DP/DR is different than psychosis. I would say I have had delusions because I wasn’t properly treated. I am now on a mood stabilizer and feel good. A bipolar drinking 8 energy drinks a day is insane, which I was doing every day for 
the past 9 years. I’m reducing or quitting them. I’m already cutting back. I’ve had philosophical delusions mainly but they go over my doctors head. I would have to talk to somebody like _PERSON_ for somebody to understand me. It sounds egotistical but it’s true. I got negative symptoms, no motivation, and obesity from the meds. I don’t care if you agree with me or not. I have bipolar genetics, a family history of bipolar, and no schizophrenics. My current doctor was pushing the bipolar diagnosis until I told him what happened to me in college. He flat out told me it wasn’t real. I even tried to convince him I’m worse off than that and had paranoid schizophrenia. We agreed to say I have schizo-affective disorder. He thinks I can do something in life. I’m not sure if all those supplements did something to me, but it helped I think. Remember, I almost died from APs. I’m not a fan anymore. It just makes me want to do nothing with my life and I’m like a vegetable. Don’t get me wrong, some pe
ople really need medication. Most people on this site need them. Without meds, I’ll be just fine. I won’t go to jail, die, or be homeless. If I relapse, I’ll just go back on. I’m not deluded. Yes, I know I sound angry. I kind of am."

176109848,"Thank you so much for the luck and well wishes I really want it to work out with work this time I’m so bored at home it’s driving me insane.

176109853,I turn to the forum instead of spiraling into a panic attack
176109854,"It is true that we can’t just sit back and expect the drugs to fix all our problems. I’m not suggesting you are, but you should really try to push yourself. Start doing things even if you don’t feel like it. Make a goal to go for a little walk each day even if its a pain. On the medical side I would keep in mind that you always have the right to change doctor. No one can refuse you this option. If you feel stuck you can tell your current doctor that if you don’t get options you will apply for a new doctor. I changed doctor. I was at my last limb. If I hadn’t changed doctor I’m convinced I would be dead by now."

It was recorded, in another dimension, and written into mine. The cacti I was collecting at the time were of the same genus as his. The difference was mine impregnated my skin whilst his didn’t touch him. He was my teacher I’m sure, but then again, I’m a sleeper not a mantid."

176109862,"I went from being someone who was told he’d never be able to work because I was a complete mess to someone with decades of experience on my resume. I’ve had a variety of jobs along the way. Some have worked out well, some not so much. I walked away from high pay in Information Technology because I couldn’t handle the stress, it not only affected my SZ, but my heart disease as well. I’ve also learned I can’t write for a living because SZ and publisher’s deadlines aren’t compatible. You absolutely need to discuss this with your treatment team. You also need to have a support network in place. You need to be med compliant because those meds are your biggest safety net. And, please, don’t bite off too much at once. I started out with a couple of hours of volunteer work per week. Then a day. Then a few days. Eventually I was up to nearly full-time volunteer work. Then I got offered a part-time job. It turned into full-time and I had to drop most of the volunteer work. This was over a per

176109865,I think it’s common to think your end is all there is. Not sure it’s too much of a stretch even for us but I’ve found schizophrenics are like people who take acid…especially if psychotic. You know someone on acid is off kilter with the rest and you can pick it. Drugs. With sz. You know they aren’t making too much sense if psychotic but if your like a doctor you can pick it pretty easily. It’s funny how delusions and positives travel along similar lines…
176109866,You’re really deep in psychosis. You’re not a terrorist nor is your ex or your bf. They aren’t the devil either.

174369941,"Schizophrenia does not include a hereditary change in the biological structure or an endogenous change in the chemical functions -whatever the observations Symptoms of sz happen in a smart way that does not cause a change in the main structure or in the natural chemical functions The change occurs in the mental concept which acquired by self-experience ,which is supposed to be used by the person’s mind to deal with all subjects and understanding everything (anything) that occurs in the internal psychological world or the external environmental world All casual factors like ,the biological causes,psychological,social and environmental do not cause schizophrenia ,and do not lead to the occurrence of the Sz as much as they are the available means that can be used in the treatment of bad side effects ( Sz symptoms) that arise from the effect of the SZ’s pathogen on the higher mental processes and the chemical background that associated with it .

I used to write stuff down; I have a whole notebook filled with stuff about my psychosis and general day-to-day life somewhere.

176109907,I guess when someone is on “welfare” in America. There’s a few reasons they’re spoke down to. People on disability are distinctly different to much the public in the USA because there is such a classism/racism and we live in such a success and “work for it” society. People on “welfare” are not disabled. While people on “disability” are. It’s just another dumb thing where America got cocky with language to make a distinction so they could allow some people to be hated on more by others with a certain terminology. Sure every systems bound to be abused. But people don’t seem to mind giving tax dollars for other stupid things we don’t need as much as they do for helping disadvantaged people…

Or, there is a third way here. In Mathematics when I learn the steps correctly, they are coded correctly, and applicable to new situations. That means, simply to avoid learning steps incorrectly.

176109946,According to Google Dr. _NAME_ is a celebrity psychiatrist. I’ve never heard of him. It’s possible he could refer you to a doc that could give you a brain scan. I had an MRI done a couple of years because I thought there was some sort of tumor that was making me into a dumba$$. Everyone kept telling me I was fine and there was nothing wrong with me. The scan revealed there was something wrong with my sinuses and I was prescribed a nasal steroid to get rid of headaches. I did find peace of mind after the MRI. I can’t factor it into my delusions anymore.

The same goes for other behavioral addictions. They need to be separated from drug addictions, because it’s just not the same. Drugs flood your brain with chemicals, the other addictions are just normal behaviors you enjoy too much. This is just part of the push for increased pathologization. One common diagnosis for all kinds of behavioral addictions would be enough."

That makes more sense to my journey but when I was a patient in the States all those years ago I was told I was more SZ Affective. I think that is more common with the thinking over there…I don’t have much mania so I think paranoid sz is more suitable. I think that more modern thing is if voices or certain symptoms it’s paranoid sz. I don’t think that is far off.

I think rumination is not just thinking a lot, it is a stream of non-productive thinking. It does not decide anything. My dictionary does not define the rumination of thinking.

I pose a question, if nothing is real then morality isn’t real and since morality isn’t real in itself how do we determine reality as a factual thing if it is something society deems real because everyone is experiencing the same thing?

That’s a teaching moment from me maybe and my whole schtick/(or brand?) … I guess you could say. I’d rather more admissions, more risks taken, and even more photos of posters, etc. If it gained more critical mass like that, I think it would be a balance and more would come out in the wash. The boy from starship dies miserably… maybe I really like tragedy. But I don’t actually think my ending is that BAD anymore and that says I’m improving.

174369965,"I found the paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-020-0827-5 Some schizophrenia-related genes were also promising drug targets (Fig. 4b) found both in WDD and Open Targets (Supplementary Table 5). ERBB2, an essential gene in the NRG1/ErbB signaling pathway, is targeted by six drugs—three inhibitors (AC-480, Mubritinib, and CP 724714) and three monoclonal antibodies (Trastuzumab, Ertumaxomab, and MM-302; Fig. 4b). This pathway is involved in schizophrenia due to its relevance to synaptic transmission and plasticity45. Moreover, it is known that NRG1/ErbB signaling triggers myelination in oligodendrocytes61. ErbB1 inhibition has been proposed as a potential antipsychotic approach62, and the anti-ErB2 monoclonal antibody Trastuzumab has been suggested as a possible treatment tool for schizophrenia63. We also found SLC6A9 (glycine transporter 1—GlyT1) inhibitors (Fig. 4b). Bitopertin (NCT01116830) and PF-_PHONE_NO_ (NCT01911676) are actually going through clinical trials for schizophrenia64
,65 (Fig. 4b). Two anticonvulsant drugs (Levetiracetam and Brivaracetam) targeting the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A are also promising in this respect (Fig. 4b). Levetiracetam (Fig. 4b) was found to improve cognition in a rat model for schizophrenia66. Brivaracetam (Fig. 4b) has never been used to treat schizophrenia, which makes it an attractive drug repositioning candidate. The links are wrong though, bitopertin trials for schizophrenia weren’t successful (although we can’t say for sure that it wasn’t due to some factor like dosing, patient selection, stage of illness etc). PF-_PHONE_NO_ actually does have an ongoing trial for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia which was supposed to end this summer. There are FOUR studies recruiting on levetiracetam and schizophrenia and an additional one that is not yet recruiting."

174369967,"Yes I would recommend trying it, it is one of the best antipsychotics along with Abilify/Rexulti, Vraylar and invega. Common side effects are akathisia and nausea and it is not very practical because you have to eat 350cal before taking it (and usually go to sleep because it knocks you). If you don’t have problems with these things it is a great med because it doesn’t cause diabetes, weight gain, sedation, prolactin elevation… as much as Risperidone."

176110039,"I think that a materialistic view of reality suggests that atoms are recycled and some are converted into energy. At the end of I think 4 years your cells have completely changed (this could be bunk it might be 8 years, but generally its a true statement) So I think reincarnation is a real thing, in a material sense. In go atoms out go atoms. And in a way that means the earth is it currently stands is in a sense the after life. In some ways you can exit the cycle, but in many ways, you can’t. Generally I get hung up not on the concept of death, but on the concept of dying being a process that might be quite traumatizing and that it would be a grueling process that will at the end leave me utterly spent and I have no recourse but to go through it. Its that fear, that makes me think a quick death and some form of euthanasia should be an option if at the end of my years, I’m utterly frightened that at any moment I will slog through a grueling death I want the relief of knowing I can end my sufferi

They never responded to my email.

176110073,I’ve done that a bit-problem I’m having is generic webmd etc pages don’t really have great information beyond the basics. Do you have any good suggestions for resources that might be a little more detailed and specific?
176110074,So the ambulance didn’t make you go to hospital?
176110075,That was the first antipsychotic I tried. Didn’t do anything for me. Maybe I was just too sick at the time or it just doesn’t work for me or I wasn’t taking enough of it. The PDoc switched me to Geodon pretty fast. Been on that ever since. But honestly I didn’t notice that that made me feel any better either until years later when I started taking the max dose. But every body is different. Good luck with it.
176110076,What are your voices saying _AT_MENTION_ ?
176110077,I’m asking my pdoc to lower my Risperdal dose down to 3mg from 4mg. Hopefully she agrees.

176110081,"Ah snap, deleted my update post by mistake. Okay, redoing it. Day 110 of Daily Essential Nutrients: Feel really good. No voices. Head is pain free, and maybe a 1 or 2 / 10 in pressure (am on 1 mg Haldol today. Might up to 2 in the evening.) Regimen is Daily Essential Nutrients, Amyloban 3399, Orthomolecular meds of 500 mg Inositol Hexanicotinate x 2 (no-flush Niacin), and Vitamin C 500 mg x2. I take some extra Vitamin C (1/4 tsp) when I feel flu-ey, it helps me feel normal in about a half hour. For my Rheumatoid Arthitis I’m taking Aleve (Naproxen), and Citric Acid + Baking Soda. The last two make a bubbly drink, it’s basically like the medication Eno. Rheumatic joints have low levels of Citric Acid in the joint fluid, it’s vital for dissolving the various painful crystals that form. Also, Citric Acid doesn’t make your blood acidic in small quantities, thankfully. My negatives are willpower based. If I could just have an “a-ha” moment and sort my life out, I feel I would be motivated to 
do things. No unseen force is stopping me from doing that, it’s just laziness and learned helplessness at this point."
176110082,"You know I am with you in some ways. There can be something magical about psychosis. I don’t miss the crippling fear and horrifying hallucinations. I miss the excitement of it. Being psychotic is constantly hugely exciting. Something huge and mysterious was always going on, some complex story line with myself as the main character. Nowadays any excitement I feel feels so tepid in comparison."

176110091,You can do it
174369989,I currently take it at 6pm because I found that to be the optimal time to avoid the anxiety it induces in me. However my days are a write off until 7:30pm and I feel really bad until then. So I’m going to try taking it at 3pm for a while to see if that makes things better.
176110092,"After my first and only psychosis, I don’t believe they’re real anymore. When my psychosis was happening, I was mostly hearing one voice that belonged to an actual real person. It belonged to a girl that I had a crush on at my second high school who graduated a year ahead of me and she was working at one of the stores here uptown. The really weird _USER_ID_ about it was when we were both at school together, in recent years, I’ve surmised that she might have liked me back!"

176110097,"I think almost all psychoses are spiritual emergencies in a way. Or cause them. Not in the sense that there was ACTUALLY a time portal in my bedroom or evil spirits or whatever. Afaik. But my life was so overwhelming and went so awry that my deepest system of meaning, of seeing myself and the world, collapsed. And i desintegrated. I had to look at my life story, integrate things, change my life to be better and find a new system of meaning and my place in that to start to feel better. This is still work in progress. For me, in that sense, it was a spiritual emergency - a crisis in my deepest sense of meaning, of being. I can attach all sorts of vague spiritual metaphors to it of paranormal awakenings…but that doesnt do justice. Neither does the “oh you just had excess dopamine, here take this pill” thing."

174369987,"I’ve said it before but a commercial for an antipsychotic targeted for schizophrenia would be great. Show somebody rocking, or pacing, maybe a person talking to themselves, then show a healthy person coping and the drug info. They could do it lightly and not even make it seem scary. It would be a great first step towards awareness. Everybody knows about bipolar now thanks to drug adverts."

Yes they have laws but everytime I told an employer they just made my life difficult or watched me like a hawk waiting for something to get rid of you. They want workers, not problems and excuses. If you want a nice employer do volunteer work until you can keep up with demands They have to make money off you not cater to you, Sad but that’s just the reality of life. No need to feel guily. They just need people at certain times and to work a certain amount. If a job is asking too much, look elsewhere. Just stay cool so you can get a recommendation. This worked for me, keep sz a secret, work hard to prove yourself so you’re just like everyone else even though we have our little secrets. Then you’re just part of the team and treated fairly.

176110124,Yeah it’s tough. Still. Most conversation is about listening and responding to cues. Most people like to talk about themselves and asking questions about them draws them out and that is how you get there. It’s totally possible to have good friends even with all we deal with. Just be open to interaction and listen and respond. You remember what someone likes and you can use that. _AT_MENTION_ years ago made a post about remembering what you like for your coffee. You remember that stuff your half way there…for example. I’m a milk two sugars…that is the stuff to remember and people like that and respond accordingly.
176110125,It varied Was given olanzapine and in a later hospitalisation i was given clozapine and valproic acid then risperidone instead of clozapine When I relapsed and went back to hospital in 2013 I was given what I’m still on today - amisulpride (later in outpatients olanzapine was added) In hospital I was also regularly sedated with lorazepam and diazepam

174370007,"My voices have been the hardest things for my husband. Mine arent always audible. When I’m not bad, they’re more like people who talk to me in my head. They talk to each other about me, give me warnings about stuff that could never be real, and stuff like that. The thing that confuses him is that they’re almost always the same people. These people have been telepathic beings from other dimensions and stuff depending on where I am in a delusions but, it’s always the same 4 people in a way. They don’t have names. My husband believes that schizophrenia should have more random voices and they shouldn’t be able to talk in a way that makes sense. I think I’m pretty standard sz.

It was the weirdest thing, I was fine during the day, standing, walking, sitting, but when I went to lay down in my bed I would have full body spasms or jerks every 10 minutes or so. They where split second events, I would jerk/spasm then be fine till the next one. Once I fell a sleep it didn’t happen anymore. Once that started happening I weened myself off it and the problem went away. Took me several months to reduce my dosage to nothing and I still had about a months worth of withdrawals."

Main reason I want to stop taking is because I want to switch to an alcohol friendly anxiety med. Maybe an AD? I mean I’m not always bursting with happiness but that’s normal right? Also I get tired of taking it (Hydroxyzine) at the right times throughout the day. I’ve talked with my pcp and pdoc about switching and they disagree with each other, one says go ahead and switch. The other says he’d prefer if I didn’t drink. And kind of left my med switch question unanswered. I would choose to drink, responsibly of course, if it didn’t interfere with my health or meds. Any advice for a guy stuck in drug/alcohol classes that UA randomly and on a non alcohol friendly med? I realize sobriety is very different than not being sober. It has its perks.

He also said that after i hurt him the last time i grabbed the heater in my room and started hitting myself in the head.

I am saying in the hospital setting where I work, the people with sza tend to have a lot more insight than those with sz. I haven’t met a single patient with sz that had insight so far, even those being discharged tend to deny they ever had a problem. That doesn’t mean no one in the world with sz has insight. It just means that is what i have observed in the hospital. I also did not say only people with sz have flat affect, I just said I have noticed it more in those with sz. I haven’t seen a patient with sza with a flat affect yet meanwhile I have only seen one sz patient who did not have one.

So it’s the feelings that are tricking us, not our minds(even after watching my recorded webcam video, I didn’t believe I never “thought out loud”(broadcasting of thoughts). first, it’s what we felt is real, then slowly our mind tuned itself and overthinks, and everything will start to “make sense”, which are not true. It’s just that our feelings are stronger than our minds, for me it was because of a few past experiences that made this manifested itself.

Learn from everyone on this site that if you take your meds as prescribed and stay on them you can still have a very good life. Never go off meds without doctors approval. That has not worked for just about anyone. Eat a healthy diet and exercise to keep the metabolic side effects of the meds to the minimum. I encourage people to sign up for a case worker when they are in early recovery to help them, and make sure your support system is educated through things like _USER_ID_ classes. I hope the recovery classes go well for you! I’ve benefitted greatly from therapy and meds.

I miss that feeling of the razor ripping through my skin, but I told myself I’d never do it again. It’s been a year and still I fight, to keep the urge at bay with all my might.

Its not that I want to feel death’s kiss, its just that I dont want to live like this. My hope seems gone but with some resolve maybe I’ll still live to see tomorrow’s dawn.

Thus, the effects of glucose hypometabolism can be bypassed through the entry of beta-hydroxybutyrate, providing an alternative source of energy to glucose. The weight of evidence suggests that induced ketosis reduces levels of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation - core features of the above disorders. There is also data to suggest that induced ketosis may be able to target other molecules and signalling pathways whose levels and or activity are also known to be abnormal in at least some patients suffering from these illnesses such as peroxisome prolifera
tor-activated receptors (PPARs), increased activity of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (KEAP)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF-2),Sirtuin-1(SIRT-1) nuclear factor (NF)-?B p65 and NAD This review explains the mechanisms by which induced ketosis might reduce mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress in neuropsychiatric disorders and ameliorate abnormal levels of molecules and signalling pathways which also appear to contribute to the pathophysiology of these illnesses. This review also examines safety data relating to induced ketosis over the long term and discusses the design of future studies."

174370091,Meds don’t cause negative symptoms. They give you side effects. The tablets just don’t do great job at treating them. My experience is that you have to overcome these things on a personal level for them to get any better. Feeling sorry for your self is only going to make you worse and put a block up to improving yourself
176110443,Thank you man

176110457,This is going to sound really weird and perhaps it’s just a placebo effect but I researched this on the internet and I found the weirdest remedy that I had to try because it was so weird. I read that if you put a fresh out of the box bar of soap (Irish spring actually) by the ankle area of the inflicted restless leg that it helps. I did this and it helped by 80%. My mother thought it was crazy and she tried it and now has a bae of soap by her bed. You can look it up and there’s other home remedies as well. I tried that because it seemed so far fetched

The voices/entities are just as real as anything else I come into contact with and never cease, so I can’t help but listen to them and have it effect me to the point that sometimes I won’t exercise because of how scared I am of them."

176110499,"It’s only fun if you have control over the time, place and context. It’s not fun if you don’t. Then, it’s pure terror. I actually am terrorized by marijuana high’s. (The only illegal drug I’ve ever engaged in). When you are naturally psychotic, illegal drug effects are much more pronounced and scary.

176110501,"I have an appointment once every two or three months, for about 5-10 minutes on the phone with my pdoc. I try not to bother him with anything unless it’s really important. Don’t feel bad that’s just standard for most people. Can you do tele-health? You can set up an appointment for him to call you if it is something important. I can relate though. I love to talk to people and when I have an idea it’s easier to externalize it than internalize my thoughts. Some things we just can’t control. some things we can work to improve."
176110502,"Slurring words is a sign of a very different state of mind. I can appear normal under certain circumstances but when i start slurring, even a tiny bit, its a wake up call to myself that I’m really messed up. Appearing sober, or being able to think and talk intelligently means nothing imho, if you’re slurring, you are over doing it. This is my extremely subjective view. I have no advise for how to deal with this situation besides just saying that I think your concerns are very valid."

176110513,"It’s so weird. For such a long time I’ve been a highly creative ideas man. I’ve dabbled in various arts and I’ve been lost in inquisitive thought for long periods of time. But now I’m not. I’m just… chill. Quiet, calm, and of a still mind. I don’t know if after a while I’ll see the blossom of a new way of obtaining fulfillment, but for right now my life is mundane. I sleep, eat, work, and watch entertainment. I feel like a normie that’s haunted by a past life where they were a genius and is now uncomfortable with the humdrum as a result. Earlier this summer I had a creative surge and wrote a teleplay, a short story, a five episode podcast, and created a really shitty game. But I decided that I didn’t like being in my head so much so I stopped the daily grind of creating. Now I’m just. On the opposite end of the spectrum. My brain just doesn’t tolerate thought anymore. It doesn’t tolerate curiosity or inquisitiveness, or ideas. It stops thoughts in their tracks and just r
eturns to its quiet hum. I’ve like, tried a lot of the things that you can teach yourself, and I’ve had varying levels of success. It feels like “been there, done that” when I think about revisiting these hobbies, and there’s nothing new I can think of to get into. I’m struggling. Trying to stay open to the future and new ways of being, but all I know are the old ways, and I can’t help but be reminded of those processes. Anyone else struggle with changing?"

I’m just lucky I was still able to write rhymes and make music while I was going through it, I’ve been even further down the psychosis wormhole in the past and could only scribble gibberish. During the psychosis that inspired this song I managed to keep my head and just observe and document. I think it’s really useful to do that for everyone with our condition to try figure out what is going on with us"

I go by _PERSON_, i’m 21yrs old and recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder after a fairly recent hospitalization. I’ve been attending a DBT group and getting individual therapy and trying to get the right meds (which hasn’t been all that fun). I am trying to understand more of this disorder, as I have had symptoms since I was about 13. My family is having a tough time accepting the diagnosis. Things haven’t been easy, as I have been out of work for almost a year now and can’t see myself returning soon. I’ve been trying to really focus on my mental health but it’s been so hard. I’m hanging in there though, and am looking forward to meeting new people that I feel like I can finally relate to, and learn about different ways for support, advice, and coping with this illness.

Then id morph back into myself, and id be smiling while everyone is crying and id be hearing ‘god’ him saying there being healed… it got about 10 times more insane but ill leave it there. my parents said anytime i changed into ‘jesus’ my eyes would go from bright blue to very dark blue. said i looked almost evil. efffed up stuff. so ill now refer to ‘jesus’ as a psychotic delusion. it was a voice that claimed to be jesus then it took over my identity. i actually dont know how that was even possible to have my personality morph into something else and back an

I’m no PsyD, but my understanding is that I must have delusions / hallucinations to have sza, assuming I don’t have disorganized speech.

I also take 2.5mg Valium at night. I’m concerned that I may get addicted to it but my pdoc said not to worry since it is a very low dosage. He said if you take 10 or 15mg each day it can become a problem. I’m also on 200mg Lamotragine. Ive been on it for about 8 years.
176110539,Someone thought I did something to their child but in my thoughts but still it is pretty terrible. I have people in my mind a lot. I try to block them out. I have someone put pictures and words in my mind. They call me racist and obscene and try to make me sound this way.

176110548,"We think that,the original phenomenon is much more complicated than describing it with the terminology (negative content in auditory-verbal ) It is supposed that the relevant subject to study is to knowing the patterns of functional activities mechanism of the voice emitter (hallucination) throughout the basic nature (biology/psychology ) of the human host It means that in reality(regardless the subjects content of the voice message); 1-knowing the nature of the raw voice material of the hallucinator emitter 2-The method of voice transmission 3- The method of receiving the voice message 4- the direct effect of the voice message on the Auditory Perceptive Receptors 5- ALL changes that take place after reception and understanding the meaning of the voice emitter message 6- All possible of the host’s responses (reactions of the recipient ) towards the voice message of the hallucination emitter the original phenomenon in nature Is ; A tow-way mutual dialogue mechanism between the hallucination emitte
r and the conscious mind of a human listener ,to exchange the higher mental data in 2 opposite direction Whereas,the hallucination emitter sends his voice message (vocal thought in nature) to the human hearer,the human listener perceives the meaning of the message content ,whereas he has 2 options,accept the meaning of the message and the result of that, the meaning of the message becomes a natural part of his personal knowledge,or reject the received message and it not be taken as a part of the self-knowledge - but he must made a mental response ( release an anti- idea immediately in about 1,2 or 3 seconds as a mix. possible time ) So,the human hearer becomes a sender (voice emitter) and transmits his mental response to the other interlocutor (hallucination which becomes a listener ) You should know the speed of the voice message (in two different directions) from the moment of beginning to the end,frequency of transmission and reception ,the rate of repetition of message exchanged per unit time,the large am
ount of neural energy that drains while sending /receiving the exchanged messages"
176110549,I would say try to mentally challenge your body into it being hungry more often if you want to lose the weight. Since you’ve had only one meal you have basically starved your stomach and lacked the nutrients that you need which causes a intense hunger which causes you to over eat. Your body does that as a defense because it doesn’t know when it will get it’s next meal.
176110550,Yeah I don’t think my heart is with the farm anymore especially facing a court case about it.

174370118,"I must add something here about doctors in general. It’s not really a reply to you but to everyone but it might just be beneficial. It’s my experience with German doctors in general. (German) doctors are there to keep you alive and safe. And to some extent, keep others safe from you so you don’t hurt yourself and anyone else. If these conditions are met, then they are fine. They don’t care if you are productive or your health is optimized or you are creative or whatever. If you are alive and safe and are not doing anything “crazy” then you are fine. Being productive and really “fine” is just not their goal. It applies to any illness not just schizophrenia. They just do away the illness. If you are hallucinating and you are hostile and they stop that, it’s great success and you are healed. end of the story. Having optimized health is the business of other people. Like Psychologists and therapists (particularly the ones NOT paid by insurance), life coaches, nutritionists, spiritual 
teachers (maybe), natural treatment people, sports trainers, meditation classes, yoga teachers, stuff like that. The stuff I’m talking about falls in this category If doctors give you Abilify or whatever. and their goal is that you don’t hear voices anymore, and you don’t, they of course see no need for any farther treatment, be it zinc or whatever else, and of course, they will view it as bulls**t. But you can refer to the studies mentioned in the original post I linked above that it’s not BS, as Zinc is almost certainly good for depression and there is some evidence that it might be good for schizophrenia (the Risperdal _PERSON_ Zinc study) (and may I add that almost all things good for depression could be good for negative symptoms, they very often use antidepressants for negative symptoms)"

I don’t know why your relapsing but all I can offer is that it may not be just one single thing alone that’s causing you to relapse, it may be a combination of things. Also, when I went through my hospitalizations in the eighties, I sometimes felt very weak and my mental state was fragile after leaving. It took me awhile to adjust to life back outside. And also, I was in a hospital for 8 months in my twenties and they put me on a huge dose of medication. But I was still psychotic the whole time and was just about ready to lose my sanity at any moment for almost the entire time. I guess my point is medication doesn’t necessarily cover every mental health situation."

I feel better in so many ways. Physically I have put on weight and would like to lose eight kg or so but I still have a normal bmi I think. I am a vegan which I am very happy with. I know who I am and where I stand more. Just two years ago I thought one of my closest was me and we have different politics and morals but we love each other anyway and are close but I realised that’s him not me.

My mum wears make up but my former step mum who I live with doesn’t. 
My mum likes me to wear lipstick and mascara and nothing else. She thinks I look so hard with more makeup on so she wouldn’t be happy to see how much I wear. My former stepmum complimented me on my make up though (when I was wearing heaps) . My x boyfriend ratcheted me wear heaps .that was his favourite look. I used to look good without makeup.

174370163,"right now im unemployed. but my favorite job was the 4 years I worked on the golf course. I had a lot of independence and worked outside in the sun, the golfers complaining about where I had put the holes for the day was annoying but my boss was cool. I regret quitting. also it had some early mornings which was another drawback. I didn’t get paid much though, but I used a lot of the equipment. of course pulling weeds out of sand traps was never fun, and neither was spraying for hornets in the par 3 8th hole sand trap. but I got to golf for free, which I rarely did because I always just wanted to go home after being on the golf course all day."

174370177,My working memory got a lot worse since having schizophrenia. I dont know if its the meds. Anyone’s working memory decreased due to sz and not aging? My working memory is bad since getting sz 10 years ago. The decrease started at around age 14-15 though.
174370170,"Physicists, not philosophers will prove it. Engineers may have a part in it. Physicists are pushing the boundaries of science and reality and looking for “cracks” in our reality like computational limitations at the small scales (plank) and large scales (quasars) I think. They are using holographic devices or lasers I think to see if reality is fuzzy at a small scale. I’m sure satellites will be deployed in the future to test these things. Similar to how a 100+ years after _PERSON_ they are proving his theories right. So far he has been right about a lot of things or possibly everything. I’ve lost a lot of respect for philosophers. Probably because I listen to physicists. I like physics but am scared of it and don’t want to major in it and probably couldn’t finish it due to the difficulty of the subject. I don’t really want to go back to school but I enjoy watching and learning online when I can. I kinda want to do a trade school thing and make money. My brother has a lot of potential
. More than me. I just worry about him. My delusions interfere with my life and emotions. I don’t think he’ll get schizophrenia but I just worry about him. He’s smart and doesn’t like school either. He’s looking into working at a fiber optics company and laying down fiber cable after doing a 6-12 month training program and getting certified to make $20-25 an hour starting off with benefits and full time. It beats most jobs. My older niece wants to be a dentist and my other niece wants to do fashion and merchandising. Too bad schizophrenia ruined my life. I rather be dumb than have schizophrenia because I was really narcissistic and selfish. I rather have dropped out for different reasons than psychosis. Like I wanted to make a ton of money fast and help my mom and have her divorce my step dad. I got too cocky and was an ??????? and a major jerk. It would have ruined my brother and hurt his feelings and cause severe issues with my family. I’m glad I got a wake up call and got schizophrenia I think. 
My parents are still married but I had no right to try to interfere. I was also a jerk to my mom and family for some time. They still loved me because I was their son."

I wish I could just get a lot better and go back to work and not have to deal with all this. The medicine I’m on has helped take the edge off but some days I want to sleep all the time and not talk. Other days my mom has to remind me not to say some things to people. I feel bad for her because she is older and having to take care of my bills, remind me to do things around the house and take me to my appointments when I know she doesn’t feel well some days."

176110737,Lobotomies actually worked for some people but for most people they did more harm than good. Basically a lobotomy procedure is inserting a wire into the brain and scraping out part of the brain. For some reason this worked but the procedure was irreversible and for many people it turned them into vegetables. One of the woman _NAME_ clan got the procedure done. It went terribly wrong and she spent decades in an institution until she died in 2005. None of the _PERSON_ liked to talk about it; she was rarely mentioned during her entire lifetime. It was a well guarded secret.

174370182,Multiple personalities? _AT_MENTION_ welcome to the forum.
176110741,It does for me also. I get lonely staying at home and going out. I guess I have to get over myself cause I can’t have something to do every minute of the day. I get bored super quick. That’s why mostly I workout to cure the boredom and get me around people. I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if I didnt work out I would die of boredom. So even when things get rough with working out I stick with it because it’s better than not doing anything at all.
176110742,I’m 59 going to be 60 next month in February. Why is there no category for those over 80? People do live that long you know.

174370175,"Most doctors will recomend you in to use clozapine instead of 3 antipsychotics. personally I find that I have less sideeffects on the 3 antipsychotics thsn I had on 600 mg clozapine 22 years ago. The clozapine made me constipated, drolling, massive weight gain. and very sedated. Clozapine should only be usef when you run out of options."
174370187,"I also take Zoloft with Lamotrigine as well as Saphris. The Lamotrigine works well for my outburst kind of mood swings, but it doesn’t keep me from depression or mania.

176110747,Is your psychiatrist forcing you to see this therapist? You shouldn’t have to see him.

176110750,Well done _AT_MENTION_ … I am sure it will get easier the more you do. Very impressed by folk who use their hands to make stuff or fix stuff. Keep on keeping on. Looks good to me
176110751,Great questions! I´m feeling like that lately. The typical answer: “Make your passion your job and you won´t need to work one day of your life” becomes questionable aswell.
174370185,"I had a small scholarship to Washington University at St. _NAME_, but I joined the army instead. I sometimes wonder where I’d be if I hadn’t joined the army. Who knows?

176110754,You need to be honest. It’s really important.
176110755,"Thanks for bumping this topic up. I had an uneven cognitive profile indicative of a learning difficulty long before I came under psych services. I’m not aware of any great cognitive decline, beyond what could be attributed to a normal,age related decline. I do know that from 18-39 I didn’t use what intellect I had very much . At 39 I first got online , and began to use my intellect a lot more. It’s interesting research, but I do wonder how relevant it is to people here . Despite our problems the fact we can contribute here suggests we are doing comparatively well in cognitive terms compared to those people with psychosis who aren’t online."

176110760,"I hope I don’t have that issue! …From what I’ve read, it seems like sleep could improve in terms of quality and duration. I often feel panicky before sleeping. Some anecdotal evidence I found online has generally pointed to multiple people saying they can really quell anxiety. With anxiety and depression, ptsd, and symptoms of benzo withdrawal, as I understand it, you get stressed out because you can’t handle the stimulation, which benzos (etc.) block due to their actions on the “gaba” neurotransmitter system… To recover from benzo withdrawal, you’ve got to slowly allow your brain to “heal” from that stress. In the meantime, insomnia and panic attacks…well…yeah. ————————- My argument summarized: -It feels like constant hug or human touch -It (arguably) balances key neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine -I truly believe that it’s like a magic bullet for anxiety This is the one I want: amazon.com Amazon.com: YnM Weighted Blanket (20 lbs, 60''x80'', Qu

176110761,How long are you on 2.5mg
176110762,Was prescribed Welbutrin and after two days of taking it I started getting more auditory hallucinations and my thoughts changed. Almost positive if I would have continued I would have had to go to the hospital. Stopped taking it and was back to the usual in about 4 days.
176110763,I had to get another psychiatrist to examine me for some government rubbish. Anyways the doc wrote I was dysphoric! I’m usually a pretty warm person but I guess one hour visit in that environment makes it so. I was not too worried about that. If my regular psydoc who I’ve seen since 1993 said it I’d be hurt!
174370181,I was on 80mg and it wasn’t enough for my positive symptoms. We upped it to 120mg but the akathisia and nausea were too much. I couldn’t sleep at night because of the akathisia. But we have different body chemistry so maybe you won’t have akathisia. Some users here take Latuda and don’t have akathisia.

176110771,"Mentally ill people neglect hygiene often. It lets them know if bad oral health might be due to mental illness and harder to treat. It also gives the dentist an idea if someone is just chowing on sugar or unable to actually care properly for themselves. Healing time and infection is higher forpeople who don’t have good oral care. The dentist will know if the patient might need extra care. ALSO, some mentally ill people have higher anxiety, so they can respond and be prepared. All sorts of reasons.

176110795,"I had a psych nurse tell me that all people with mental health issues can work. How do I feel about that? Well, it’s too easy for outsiders to label us as say being lazy when really there are other factors at work. We have to fight against a couple hundred years of _USER_ID_ tbh. But I did learn early on that it’s the job of workers in the mental health field to push us even if we may not like it. I may have missed the mark on your question OP so these are just my thoughts."
176110796,I’m sorry to hear that. I hope you’re able to recover quickly from the surgery.

I don’t know half of who they are talking about but that doesn’t seem to matter.

176110810,"So everything you described is very similar to an episode I had a few weeks ago. I had been using a lot of THC for an unrelated physical medical condition, and I went down the rabbit hole a bit. And when I mean everything, I mean even being scared that aliens were real and using actual bugs (which are everywhere) to listen in (which was why a listening device would be called a “bug”), etc. But in the process of all of this, I figured a few things out for myself that were extremely helpful, and I’ll share them here if it might be helpful to you. First, a bit of background: I’m not sure how interested you are in quantum physics, but there’s this weird phenomenon at very low levels of matter that the state of things can be two (or more) things at the same time. It doesn’t make sense, but this is actually what happens, as non-intuitive as it is. There are a few explanations for why, and one of them is that multiverse idea you mentioned (the “many worlds” interpretation), which in a rece
nt thought exercise paradox was the one interpretation that offered both a universal and consistent modeling of quantum mechanics. So obviously even if there are many worlds, I can’t just change matter by thinking it. No matter how long I might stare at a spoon, it doesn’t bend. Which sort of makes sense, as would it be fair to you if you’re eating cereal and I could bend your spoon. You and I would have to be in a constant mental battle to just finish your breakfast. So there’s a convenience for social interaction in all of us sharing a measurable universe. But things that we don’t share observations of? Such as whether I think Stranger Things is a good TV show? I can have whatever opinion I want. And I can change that opinion with some effort. (Really, try watching a show you don’t really care for and then deciding you are going to enjoy it - you may find that you can succeed in changing your own experience of reality). During my existential break, I realized that I could do the same thing with 
what I was experiencing. The foundation for being able to do this was accepting that in all likelihood, based on how the quantum superposition can be two or more things at once (and even re-establish such a state “backwards” in time), that there wasn’t so much “A or B” but rather “A and B” - and which version of reality I chose to observe was up to me. So in realizing this, I understood a lot of why I was feeling that the universe was “out to get me” was because I didn’t think I deserved eternal happiness. So I forgave myself. I decided that in general I’m a good enough person, above average on the morality scale and continuing to put in a bit of effort to continue in that direction, and that that was enough. But it was still throwing me for a loop that SOME people deserved Hell, and what if I was just rationalizing my own behavior. So I decided to forgive other people too. I constructed an explanation for our reality that seemed plausible and would guarantee salvation for everyone. I ev
en reinterpreted Hell as not being a place where bad people go to be tortured, but as a place where bad people go to torture other (simulated) people that successfully pass the _PERSON_ test. Which I guess would be a really bad person’s idea of Heaven (like a super-realistic Grand Theft Auto game). After all, since my idea of Heaven probably doesn’t match up perfectly with yours, wouldn’t it be far more ethical for each of us to get our own private version of paradise, rather than needing to compromise? And that’s the thing. Because unobservable things like the nature of reality or what happens after we die aren’t able to be a shared observable like which slit a photon goes through (which needs to collapse to a single outcome for us to all share a reality), why not assume that every possibility exists and we have the ability to actively shape which _NAME_-physics apply to us, as long as we all come together in the _PERSON_ diagram of this shared reality while we are alive? If you are interested in m
y personal take on what the nature of reality is and how we are all deserve Heaven, I’d be happy to share it, but ultimately I don’t believe you have to adopt my own take on things (and as such, I didn’t want to suggest my version unless asked lest it taint your own version). I really do think each of us has the ability to write our own explanations for what and why we exist, and can make that explanation as positive or negative as we choose. And I do think those themes of self-forgiveness and the forgiveness of others that come up in world religions is an important process in being able to write a positive story even in the face of a world wrought with tragedy and suffering. And given the likelihood of a multiverse, and the very considerable possibility that consciousness spans across the multiverse (are you actually making a decision or simply choosing which multiverse to observe?), it’s altogether likely that what reality you write for yourself is as real as any reality put forward by others. Anyho
w, I hope that this perspective is as useful to you as it was to me. It seriously changed how my mind would run into manifesting a nightmarish reality in which I was terrified into one where, with a bit of constant effort (it’s easy to slip back into being scared of things), I can remind myself of the nondual nature of reality and actively decide what version of reality I’m choosing to observe."
176110811,"i knew something was wrong the minute i started to feel off, it just got worse and i was in denial, trying to hide it, i couldnt talk about it, just tried to deal with it myself but i couldnt, it just kept getting worse until i snapped."

176110818,Yes. My heaviest was 71kg duo to antipsycotic meds! I took 1 year to lose those 15kg.
176110819,"I think it’s great to have a list of goals. As long as you know you may not achieve all of them, then what’s the harm in aiming high? It’s like how in school, if you aim for A’s, you might get A’s or B’s or C’s. But if you aim for C’s, which is still passing, you’ll most likely fail. I say go for it! Try your best!"

176110823,Yes. She didn’t want me to have a man.
176110824,"Could you post the info saying this is a side effect? Because it sounds like it’s definitely a delusion and not a side effect. I also have absolutely no idea why you’re taking your psychiatrist to court over this. It seems excessive and ill-founded. Also, considering your posting history, I’d say it’s pretty unlikely that you would experience a strange side effect from meds and highly likely that you would experience hallucinations and delusions caused by your fear of meds. I think you should drop this case against your psychiatrist, for your own sake."
174370195,My mother fed my delusions as a child. I thought I was possessed for the longest time. She took me to her religious elders and they said I was being followed by demons. My whole family on her side thought I was. Now that she knows I’m Schizophrenic she told me not to tell my relatives. Not sure if it’s because they won’t believe the diagnosis or if she is embarrassed.
174370200,I was diagnosed with schizophrenia 13 years ago. I was only on one meds (risperidone) for a year or so. It turned me into a zombie and I couldn’t do anything on it. Been drug free since then. I haven’t seen a therapist in years. I don’t think my husband took it seriously then or does now. I never talk to him about what I’m feeling. I have no one to turn and things are getting worse for me. I’m super stressed with school right now and the voices are getting louder and meaner. I just don’t know what to do anymore.
176110825,"I remember noticing a few people got unusually defensive, or just found it funny like I was telling a joke. Can’t remember exact words apart from the phone number thing."
176110826,"You know, oddly enough, not until I developed schizophrenia did I have the best times of my life, because it sent me at first on a spiritual journey of purpose and meaning. I started doing things I never dreamed of doing before. At age 20, in one year I wrote a 100,000 page novel, was painting, dancing, exploring spirituality, and through it all traveling with friends for disaster relief. Through it all I was hallucinating. Then I met my husband, got diagnosed, and was desperately in love and went through so many adventures, it felt like my life had started all over again. Those were good times."
176110827,"I used to think I could control things, so now to test it… if I’m watching or listening to something I say “stop” and it doesn’t stop… so I know I’m not controlling it."
176110828,I tried duolingo but never got far.
176110829,Since I was on meds I’ve had almost zero physical feeling in sex. What was sad was I was normal sex libido before I got married then a few months after my marriage I lost it due to having to return to meds. Been married eight years and never got a single climax in sex. I’ve given up worrying about it. I guess it’s just not meant to be.

My pot belly was very pronounced and excessive. I had it for many years. I was not in the mood for exercise. Now after all these years my weight is spontaneously going down. I have lost about 17 pounds in 3 months. I see doctors who have been a little concerned, but they also say weight loss is very good for me. There can be very gradual changes with diet, but that too has many problems. Do you eat when you are extremely hungry? I think almost anyone would."

176110845,I have been taking Geodon since 2009. I take 80 mg twice a day. I also take 40 mg of Latuda. The erectile dysfunction is too much of a problem now. I can’t deal with it anymore. Not to mention all the other side effects. I don’t see my doctor again until February so I will have to wait a while. I only see him once every six months now. I am pretty stable. Owe that to Geodon but I have to come off it. Hopefully he can see me more often while I dose down. I have quit it cold turkey before and that’s too much to handle. I want to go down to 60s and then 40s and then 20s before I go off. I will just dose up the Latuda. Not sure what the maximum dose of that is but I guess I will find out. How is Latuda by itself for psychosis? I just take it on top of Geodon because it helps with my negatives. I don’t post much any more but this will be a major change for me.

I tried phentermine but it didn’t work for me, I think I lost 6 pounds in a month and a half. It really didn’t change my appetite too much. My problem is I have no appetite all day, I can’t force myself to eat breakfast most days, or lunch usually and then I eat one meal with a ton of calories. My sister says that messes up my metabolism and I just store all the calories instead of burning any. Also I don’t exercise. But if you have a big appetite and that’s the problem the phentermine might help you. It didn’t react badly with any of my meds. It was quite mild actually. I didn’t get the jitters or anything, I didn’t feel any side effects at all."

176110862,"I too get surprised by the voices often. They generally aren’t hostile to me however. I hear what I think I don’t want to hear or couldn’t have possibly imagined by myself. In the end, this is not an argument for real entities behind the voices. You personally could have subconscious mistrust of some kind, hence apparently surprising remarks.

I’m supposed to be getting an interview for one, something I could possibly turn into a real career, fingers crossed that I get it and can handle it. Like _AT_MENTION_ said, check with Social Security and see what your options are for attempting full-time work.

176110889,"I did, interesting and fun film, for sure."
176110890,"Yes, my wife left me."
174370209,Im also on 10 mg. The important thing is If you feel it helps.
176110891,Not with the virus around. I wouldn’t go.
176110892,Welcome back _AT_MENTION_ . Good to see you again.
174370205,I waited until I trusted my boyfriend to share with him that I had schizoaffective. It took a good while bc when we first started dating he told me he didn’t think he could date someone like that. Made me very anxious. But things turned out great.
176110893,Topic is masturbation. I’m not sure how unplanned pregnancies and std’s…that requires another person? I’m not sure this sex thing your doing right. Thus<
176110894,"Ipseity disturbance, ego loss. I have it since childhood"
176110895,I’d stick around and make sure he was helped.
176110896,Please remember that discussions of unusual beliefs should be in a recovery-oriented context. Posts that amplify or justify each others’ unusual beliefs will result in locking the thread.
176110897,Thanks! I appreciate that. I’m always very insecure about whether I’m stupid or not.
176110898,Welcome. It really does help to be proactive in your health especially when it comes to psychiatric illness. See you around.
176110899,_AT_MENTION_. You can have unusual beliefs and not be delusional! It’s like if you believe in a god that I don’t I can say you have an unusual belief but you’re not delusional (just an example I mean no harm by this example)
176110900,YES. Absolutely. They consume every aspect of my life. I’m constantly in flight-or-fight mode which is terrifying and draining because of what the entities do to me.
176110901,Good job. I’ve been sober for over 8 months now.
176110902,Thanks… I did try… Drank coke today so thought I’d make use of the energy kick…
176110903,I just worry I hear voices because I am someone more important (one of a 1000 or so people who they are picking for this plastic surgery). They say politicians hear them too. I have _PERSON_ delusion but a senator (who isn’t sz) has this too that I read in the paper and worry that I’m just like him. My ex-boyfriend worked for the Republican Party so I’m worried it might be connected to this and my boyfriend who I think is the devil.
176110904,And all I can think about is suicide. I just want to kill myself.
176110905,"I would think that my voices might not actually be real. Love to smoke, makes me feel better. When I quit I get angry and my relationships suffer from it. I don’t let any voices in my head tell me to do something that doesn’t feel right."
176110906,"Yes, but that doesn’t mean I can’t ask for emotional support. I am so scared and although I know what to do, I am emotional and sad for her."
176110907,I got dizzy when I took naltrexone because I took it with lots of medications. I achieved to block the hight of alcohol when they added qutiapine to my mix.
176110908,"Thanks _AT_MENTION_ , you impress me for being able to write such a nice, positive response. You’re lucky enough to have a brain that still functions on a good enough, high, level to write that. I appreciate every word of what you wrote and of course, I wish you good luck in any endeavor you may try."

176110916,It sounds like you need a punching bag or something. Maybe hitting a pillow? I dunno. Seems like you need an outlet for your frustrations. I don’t know what your physical capabilities are at your age but I would recommend getting some frustrations out with exercise if you can.

176110920,"Trust me o felt like you before I stopped my medication and had the same mentality: "" I’ll lose a lot of years of my life to APs; side effects are horrible: I’ve been long enough on medication"". The reality is that you will lose more years if you relapse by spending rebuilding your life, you won’t even notice when you will have full blown psychosis and mania and end up locked in a hospital again. What I can only recommend is going on therapeutic dose of medication for few months and see how it goes: if you feel better with less side effects that means maybe you can stay on that low dose indefinitely"
176110921,To make myself more clearer. This makes me sound like I’m a gay person and people do think I’m gay and I don’t really have a problem with that but I drink in rough pubs as I am rough and this can be a problem. People say I have a posh accent but here in the UK equivalent would be ghetto housing area in the US and it can be bad. Should I be proud of myself?

176110929,"If it so satisfies my tears to flow, Let me read what my tears are trying to say, as they flow from my eyes; I have explored throughout the darkness, but found no answers, But only the deep, dark abyss filled with angry, screaming people. I see my mother, my father and my brother, screaming; I see my cousins, aunts, and uncles, yelling; Screaming false ideas upon the darkness and filling the corner with sorrow, Cornering me with their words that are sharp as spears. My tears do not speak of false truth. If the world perceives darkness as truth, then I perceive it as false. I’ve explored far and beyond, and I only see them yelling beneath the crevice, Amongst the piles of dead souls, seeking resurrection. “What you are saying is not true.” I say to them; But they respond, “I shall kill you also and let you join these souls who are dead.” Aren’t they my family members, who tended me since birth? And aren’t we all interconnected through the souls of our ancestors? This is the end of my e
xploring, the search for answers amongst deep darkness; I dare not to look more- only it will satisfy the tears to flow. So then, I move forward, lean upon my sorrow, and weep. I shall depart and see this darkness no more."
176110930,"I wake up around noon and make lunch. Then I walk my dog. Come back home and write some poetry/listen to music, watch TV. Sleep for a bit. Go for a drive with my dog. Come back and make dinner. Chill out, read a book, browse the web, play some video games. Go to sleep couple hours past midnight. That’s my boring day. How do you spend yours?"
176110931,that’s what I was sort of thinking too. guess I may try calling around. is cbd (pure 100%) very helpful for schizophrenia? in what ways? and what dosage should I be shooting for per day? I’ve heard strengths ranging from 300 to 3000mg per 30ml.

176110933,I feel like my house is bugged and everyone in the neighborhood is spying on me. I feel like a reality tv star. I used to be pretty stressfully but I am getting used to it.

176110936,Great that you’re stable enough to watch videos and such. I am not quite at the point of being able to watch videos with background noise / lots of people talking at once. I have to mute it so as not to hallucinate.

But will this stop my pain one day? Could you recover in sz with “efforts”? I need some courage on this, cause I have no other option for fighting the sz anymore…I try to break the sedentary, the loneliness, the delusions, but it’s still so fragile that I dont know if itll work… Anyway, you all seemed to believe in the meds, but the meds never fixed my thinking nor my emotions.

I have been told numerous times that my hallucinations are very atypical. In fact when I look up my hallucinations they most match LSD hallucinations, though I have never taken illicit drugs of any kind. Interestingly the meds that have worked best for me have been meds that primarily blocked the receptors that LSD binds to (5HT2A) as opposed to meds that blocked dopamine receptors. Ones that had weak 5HT2A binding had little to no efficacy for me and just gave me bad negative symptoms."

Racism can be ‘prosocial’ to a limited extent within the narrow boundaries of the tribe, however disgusting and ill-founded these beliefs might be.

The aim is unclear as to what the virus was intended to do, but it seems population control is at the crux of these theories. These are just nutter theories, though. Truth be told, the virus is reported to have originated from bats sold for human consumption in Wuhan marketplaces. No one could have seen this coming. If you think back to the early-1900’s, that was the last major pandemic the world faced-- the Spanish Flu. No way they had the technology to bio-engineer such a thing in those days, and yet many lost their lives because of it."

176111032,Only benzo seems to be helping my panic disorder
176111033,"This supplement helped me get past a symptomatic plateau where antipsychotics and Amyloban 3399 couldn’t. With the two together I always heard a little something in the background when I wasn’t listening to music, and if I tried hard enough to interact with it, I could. It seemed as if the two only worked to a certain extent, and the symptomatic rest you just had to “live with”. Enter D.E.N., which seems to have pushed past the plateau, and facilitated the kind of blood-brain barrier healing that has reduced my chronic headache to the point of being comfortable, as well as reducing my voice symptoms to the point of being almost gone. That last 1% of voice reduction takes forever, but it gets noticeably less every day. That final percent like locks on to your conscious mind and tries to feed it some garble about being “the chosen” or whatever, at a level that is just at the boundary of perception. I can sort of function with that marginal level of interference, but I want total voice ces
sation and zero hallucinations before I can feel confident enough to go outside often and live a semi-normal life. I imagine once the voices go away fully, my thought broadcasting will soon follow. For 23 days of progress I am pretty happy with the results, particularly with my headache. I can watch videos fairly comfortably now. Some other things I’m doing are eating low fat / low sugar, wheat / dairy / soda / junk food avoidance, and drinking low ORP water (hydrogen-infused water) to reduce inflammation, but I think you can get away with not doing that last one, it just helps marginally."

From a research article: OBJECTIVE: Clozapine causes few extrapyramidal symptoms and is recommended as a treatment drug for severe tardive dyskinesia (TD).

176111073,"Sometimes I think bitterness and delusions spar on narcissism. But I don’t think that makes one narcissistic personality disorder but rather an “ego” which everybody has. I just wanted to get my ego to normality. But by fighting it it made it grander in a way. Because there was nothing wrong with it to start. I’m not sure if I can explain this perfect. But by chasing a non ego it created a duality. And due to financial and emotional support I’ve allowed my ego to breath. Because my dad is a businessman, because a girl called me “perfect” because they said the building would be mine one day. It hyped up my ego. But I fought the ego. I’m definitely not a narcissist. But I have a lot of duality with the ego and non ego. Ughhhhh psychological ????????. Going to bed I’m tired."

/ creadibility,because the viewer did not see,hear ot touch these existence symptoms which located within the person’s conscious state The external observer is like a witness who has not seen anything,and cannot diagnose the internal symptoms of the sz There is no direct source of knowledge for the external viewer except the data content of the report that the person submitted about the existential manifestations that he felt internally inside his conscious state For example,the external viewer cannot observe / diagnose the vocal thoughts that a person hears and cannot see the images of the dynamic imaginations that a person sees, In spite of that, the external viewer insists that all data content of the report presented by the person is 100 % error,while he ignores the fact that he does not have any scientific tools to prove that if the person does not feel or feel anything !"

They think because I’ve been making a lot of gains in the past seven years since diagnosis that I can do it. But I feel like if I get breakthrough psychosis every four years I should take a less stressful job. They think that the problem is infrequent enough that I can just get a doctors note once every four years and push past it.

176111207,Welcome _AT_MENTION_!
174370300,"_AT_MENTION_ , what you have to accept is that you will never recover a 100%. But none of us will. You have to accept that you probably will never have a full life. But chances are that none of us will. BUT… there are still things you can do. I don’t know what those things are but maybe people can give you suggestions from their own experience and suffering if you ask. Having schizophrenia means a lot of compromising. And I should add here that you may be a victim of a common mistake that many people fall for. Lots of people live their lives wanting to do great things and make positive changes but they are always waiting for “the right time”. If anyone bases their life on waiting for that perfect time to do things you are likely going to be sorely disappointed the majority of the time. It’s a little like they used to tell me in AA, “The best time to go to a meeting is when you don’t feel like it.” So in other words you may have to do something in your life that every fiber in your b
ody is telling you that you don’t want to do it but that is the best time. If you want to change your life it’s going to be uncomfortable and it means doing stuff you don’t feel like doing. You might even have to do stuff you hate or stuff you think is pointless. But in the long run. it can help you. Some of it may be easy, some of it may be hard. But that’s how you grow in life. You may have to make changes which a lot of us hate or are afraid of. But you have to start somewhere. Success ain’t going to come knocking at your door. you have to make the initial changes to help yourself but fortunately there are people out there who want to help you with this. People on here would offer support and advice in this area. You won’t have a full perfect life but you can certainly make some kind of small changes, you can add several small things to your life and see how it goes. A lot of us had that one special person who saw something in us that we didn’t see in ourselves and they had faith in us and po
inted it out and helped us achieve something. Personally, I didn’t think about working much when I got out of the hospital after 8 months. I had no plans to go back to work but counselors saw potential in me and after a series of small steps I eventually became employed and I still am. You might not have that person ( or persons) in your life right now but you never know, if you get out there a little and do a few things you might eventually run into someone like that. But yeah, you may never get as much out of life as you think you should but you can still add things to your current life. But everything is a risk, just getting out of bed in the morning is a risk, lol. But there’s something called a calculated risk. Do something new that you know you will probably succeed at and give it a shot. And once you accomplish that you can build on it. So I hoped this helped a little but. None of us are perfect but we all have our good points and our strengths (and weaknesses). We all have our cross to bear, but I 
find after 58 years that most people have potential. But like I said change can be painful and uncomfortable but it can really pay off in a positive way."

176111264,"Yes, the healthcare people who work with shizoprenic people know that there is no link between murder and the disease. I have never gotten violent when in psychosis. Deep down I know that it’s me there’s something wrong with and not the people around me trying to help. It is true that some people get violent, but that mostly stems from fear and paranoia, not a desire to injure anyone. They are afraid that the people around them are trying to hurt them because they themselves are deluded and can’t see reality clear."
174370308,"As someone who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, I face living in an alternate world. That doesn’t mean that my memory is no good. In fact, I remember more than most. I remember the stories I hear from other worlds, dimensions and gateways. I remember my understanding of them and the train of thought that once led me to believe. I remember the feelings that swell inside me from my encounters. Feelings that are much to often misunderstood by others. I try not to forget anything. I try to remember the exact words that stream out of your mouth, so that I can recall them later and analyse them further. I remember people so well that I can hear them speak to me even when they’re not around. And yes, I can remember the story that normal people believe too. Some people think that because I’m part of those other worlds it means I can’t participate in their world. They try to medicate me, to keep me in one reality, theirs. Yet if they only could see the beauty that I have seen when I venture wi
th my mind. If only they could feel the joy as I travel in these worlds simultaneously. I can hold more than one conversation at a time, I can be in two places at once. It is like magic hearing a wealth of information flowing into me. Stories of our beginning and stories of other worldly beings. There is sci-fi, adventure, horror and thrillers. My stories can bring laughter and joy. A show in my mind that is never ending. I feel like a stream that refreshes on a hot summer day. However, that stream can flood, I know it can. It can flood so bad, that I overflow the riverbanks in which my family stands on. Yet when a river floods, people don’t say to the river, stop being a river. They find ways to work with the river, just as it is. I don’t want to flood, nor do I want to spend my life worrying that I will one day flood. Flooding is just a reality of people with schizophrenia. That doesn’t mean that I want to stop being a river, I enjoy my stories and I know that you could to. I want people to hear these 
stories so I can share a bit of that beauty that I find in other worlds. Perhaps, just like me, they can learn from them. I say, build your channels to guide my river but don’t dry me out. Because I won’t be there to refresh you one day, when you need a good story, a good movie, and a good laugh."

Chronic anger puts you into a fight-or-flight mode, which results in numerous changes in heart rate, blood pressure and immune response . Those changes, then, increase the risk of depression, heart disease and diabetes, among other conditions. Forgiveness, however, calms stress levels, leading to improved healt Forgiveness is not just about saying the words. “It is an active process in which you make a conscious decision to let go of negative feelings whether the person deserves it or not,” _PERSON_ says.

176111308,"GEN - Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News – 31 May 19 Gene Editing Startups Fabricate Industrial-Grade CRISPR Tools The old DIY CRISPR tickles some, but it underwhelms others, namely, the developers of commercial applications. They prefer the new CRISPR—scalable, reliable, and deliverable. Inscripta… is developing a high-throughput, multiplexed genome editing platform that will, _PERSON_ asserts, allow scientists to perform tens of thousands of insertions, deletions, and swaps in one experiment. “The traditional CRISPR/Cas9 approach performs one _USER_ID_, querying one area of the genome, one _USER_ID_ at a time,” _PERSON_ notes by way of contrast. “That’s a very limited, laborious way to interrogate a genome or to create a specific cell.” “CRISPR and gene editing tools are very powerful,” says _NAME_, founder, chairman, and CEO of Ligandal. “But you still have to get the edits into the right cells.” Otherwise, gene editing won’t make the transition to gene therapy. 
Ligandal uses ligands to form nanoparticles and package genetic materials without viruses, causing cells to “eat” (endocytose) the nanoscale packages and deliver precise genetic instructions to target cells…the goal is to predictively manufacture optimized nanoparticles for given cell types, payloads, and therapeutic applications. In preclinical studies, Ligandal’s technology has successfully targeted specific cells in the blood and bone marrow. It appears to have applications in a wide range of gene therapies."

176111377,"just have to find some good meds, they do help if you’re on ones that work for you"
176111378,_AT_MENTION_ please bring these thoughts up with your treatment team. It’s religion and it’s a big trigger for our community.
176111379,"I voted ‘no’ in this poll when it was made, but now my answer would be a resounding ‘yes’, because I’ve learned I can endure hardships far beyond what I once thought myself capable of handling."
176111380,My son lives with his dad. I get to talk to him once a week. He’s a very sweet and creative kid. He once told me a story he made up and one of the main characters was named Pastor _PERSON_. Haha. My daughter is 24 now but growing up she was a very spunky kid. She could put her legs behind her head. She could also sing and dance really well. She was strong as an ox. She never ceased to amaze me. She was very stubborn though and would rather get punished than lose a battle. I think I aged more quickly cos of her stubbornness.
176111381,"In my culture, dreams that are usually violent is considered an omen for good fortune. Strange, right? My mom dreamt of killing a cat a night before my brother’s audition. My brother passed that audition and now he’s in uni! In all honesty, dreams are just dreams…my culture has a tradition of dream interpretation, haha. But I don’t think you are inherently violent."
174370359,"I walk almost every day of the week, and workout with simple HIIT about 3-4 times a week. I do feel better in a way after. I had a career in fitness before sza. Even tho I’m obese I still like to exercise. Even starting by walking one day a week can help, start slow to avoid burn out or injury."
176111382,"Some medicines take up to 2 months to reach full effect, so I think you need to give it some time. Also, doctors like to start people on low doses so they can get used to the drug before they increase the dose if it needs increasing, so if it helps somewhat but not enough, here’s always the possibility of having your dose raised."
176111383,"I like browsing this forum, vaping, drinking coffee and playing games occasionally. Also upgrading and fixing my PC."
176111384,"i did some pretty reckless things but im not sure if i consider them ‘bad’ , me and my brothers once filled up a supersoaker watergun with gasoline, lit the end on fire and then shot out like a 20ft flame down our driveway, and out onto the street. This motorbike guy slammed his brakes so we shut the garage real quick and hid inside lol. dont leave your kids home alone folks lol"
174370343,Why would a vaccine for norovirus be helpful in schizophrenia?
176111385,I’m bored…: idk what to do
176111386,I lost count and it depends on when you call it a psychotic episode.
174370346,"No, but it’s a very hard illness to deal with. Same thing with our families. I think the science behind it has been overlooked. Just look at how fast they are working on covid-19. They already have fast tests and possible vaccines. It’s because it’s more important in a way. Schizophrenia deserves more attention and effort. Personally, and I’m in the minority here, I think schizophrenia is caused by a virus in my situation. I’m not saying that everyone was infected by a virus in the womb or as a child, but I think I was. One of my thoughts is it’s a common virus like the Norovirus, but I am getting a lot of criticism for this. It came in one of my dreams, I guess. I don’t know if it’s real or not. A dream might be a scapegoat for reality that I’m scared to talk about. It felt so real like it was a real visit from the government. They said they sequenced my DNA and that I had it as a kid. My hearing isn’t that good or even at the time. But I looked into it and it has some weight t
o it, although not that much. I think it could be 50-100 years before we have a true cure. I figure just like our hair, they can test our feces for the illness. I believe I have the second type of schizophrenia where negative symptoms are very predominant. I think it’s more severe in some ways: I have had my intelligence, executive functioning, motivation, etc. all decrease substantially. I can barely motivate myself to shower and brush my teeth anymore. I can’t work or go to school because of it even though I am trying so hard. My room is a mess too. In summary, yes, despite my average IQ (now), I think I can flourish and be successful in the future. I hope to make money, be happy, and have a wife and kids."
176111387,Yeah i can not stop Invega right now but i am thinking about switching to Abilify Maintena.

176111390,"I used to work as an assistant to an oral surgeon, What you’re feeling is completely normal and kind of part of the process. I think everyone gets a little panicky when they realize all their teeth are actually gone. But don’t get too upset, Its better than having broken, infected teeth."
174370347,"I take saphris, it’s been the best so far. Similar effect on me as Latuda, but less side effects. Only sideeffect I’ve had some days were a few days of increased anxiety. Knowing it would pass made it easier to deal with."

176111394,I took zopiclone for years. Needed more and more. Weaned myself off but it was terrible. My clozapine helps me fall asleep but unfortunately not stay asleep. I also took melatonin for awhile. It helped a bit.
176111395,"I’m still driving a 2005 Chrysler town &county _NAME_ we’ve been in 4 accidents, not the prettiest thing, but works still, under 100k miles. Got it when my grandparents were alive and we moved in in 2006 in SD. _PERSON_ died shortly after we got there, _PERSON_ died in 2013 2 days after Xmas, november and December are the killer months in our family. Most are born, married, or die in those months, including 2 of my kids being born. But she’s _PERSON_, our tank. I think a total of maybe 4k in repairs on her so far, last 1k was in August when her front axle broke and all struts were replaced. She still gets about 25mpg in city, 29ish on highway but we don’t leave town cause I’m the only one who drives it. _NAME_’s car is a 2014 _NAME_ fusion, no repairs yet, pay 334 dollars a month payment, got a good deal cause accident that made us get it totalled a brand new car. How we made it out no injuries no idea. Hit at 60mph in city thru a red light turning to take kids to Toys r us for a pokemo
n event in 2016 in think. The dealer cut 8k off the car for us, and we “won” a 60 inch smart tv in their drawing causebitvwad Thanksgiving. We’ll continue to use that _NAME_ dealer. _NAME_ was paid for when we got it, _PERSON_ worked for Chrysler for 35 years so he had that employee discount still. 36k _NAME_ with discount, but it helped cause he had Parkinson’s and cancer, easier for transporting him."
174370357,So far so good with the abilify. 10mgs is working well. Voices still there. I want to thank everyone who has helped and gave their opinions and shared experiences they had with abilify. Especially _AT_MENTION_

176111402,"Psychiatry is unfortunately trial and error. When I used to refuse community treatment they just sent me to the hospital as I wasn’t taking my meds. This cycle lasted 5 years or so. Eventually I came to the realisation that if I do what I am told, even though I fundamentally disagree with the treatment, then I will be stable and stop the damage I was doing to my brain by having so many relapses. I would urge you to take a fair few steps forward in terms of insight, as it just causes pain for everyone. Joining this site and posting here is a good start."
176111403,That guy is a jerk. I completely understand how you feel.
174370352,"If you stopped all meds, you should get back your libido. Antidepressants are known to reduce libido more than antipsychotics. As for loss of emotions, sz itself can cause that and not only the medication."

176111405,That’s how I feel about my music. Takes me like two months to judge it. I like my last few songs tho I can tell I’ve improved more. But still Time=best testament
176111406,"I’ve been four times Last time was 2017. That was the year I finally came to terms with my illness and complied with all the meds they were giving me I was transferred from a NHS hospital in the UK to a private hospital due to lack of space - the private hospital was very nice. It was like a hotel - cleaners would clean your room and change your bedsheets every day. Food in the private hospital was excellent, and they had a rule that you couldn’t wear pyjamas or jogging bottoms in the dining area It was in the private hospital that I started seeing big improvement in my mental health"
176111407,Absolutely. TW: I used to see the word “suicide” in text all the time when I was reading. Had to stop reading for a while as a result. It was really frightening.
174370364,"Oh geez. I hope it’s not a warning sign or something. I don’t know about sensory overload but I get generally overloaded when there’s stuff going on , especially at Christmas."

176111409,"I’ve actually witnessed people changing, one minute one person, next minute another with identical physical appearance but different “soul”, it hasn’t been making me very paranoid, as nobody has actually threatened me, but I have believed it without question. It has made reality quite complicated though also interesting to an extent. Thank you."
176111410,That’s not good everyone deserves someone.
176111411,"Hey man, you’re only young once. Sex is not evil or harmful and you’re going to get to my age (60) fast and you’re not going to have a strong sex drive. Practicing abstinence when you’re in 40’s or 50’s is just wasting the precious last years before you get old and abstinence is not a choice, it’s just a fact of life. But yeah, to each his own, but if you’re practicing abstinence in your twenties or thirties it just seems like such pointless waste of youthful energy and stamina."
176111412,No worries Chordy…
176111413,"Early this morning, I was laying in bed with my dog when I heard someone ring the doorbell. Our doorbell doesn’t work, but still I didn’t think anything of it. So my mom answered and then she and this other woman talked for a minute and I assumed it was the neighbor. Then my mom said thank you and closed the door and said something about _PERSON_ and that was that. So just now, I asked my mom who it was and she said none of this happened. Like at all. Which now that she’s said that, it makes sense because a) the doorbell’s broken, and b) I heard it very clearly even though my room’s in the back of the house. I’ve been stressed since my dog escaped yesterday and ran across the busy avenue. Twice. Like cars were stopping and shít. It was bad. Thank God she’s safe, but I’ve never been so scared in my life. But the concerning part is that almost all of my hallucinations have been visual since being stabilized a couple of years ago, and when they are auditory, they were mild sounds and 
stuff like that, never a full-blown conversation. I feel like I could chalk this up to stress from my dog, but I’m still freaked."
176111414,Probably not yet… The doctor says my a1c and fasting glucose are good… My BP med amlodipine and risperidone make me thirsty I think and risperidone dries my mouth out. Amlodipine is a diuretic so it’s tricky to keep it balanced.
176111415,"My states governor just closed all k-12 schools for 3 weeks, and my college has suspended classes for a week and moving all classes to online. I read a post on facebook that made a lot of sense. It said, and I paraphrase, “In the near future everything we have done responding to the virus may seem like we overreacted because of a low death count or not a lot of people being sick, but that’s the point, a low death count and less people being sick is the goal of these precautions.” I hope people dont panic more, but taking the precautions recommended by the CDC, or whatever your government disease control organization is, will help prevent the spread of the disease to at risk populations."
176111416,"I used to get this all the time when my illness first started and a little bit now, but it got better over time with talking more and taking medication. It’s called lack of thought, and to my knowledge it’s a negative symptom. It was especially hard during my catatonic period, though. My main suggestion is try to get put on an SSRI antidepressant; it helped a lot for me."

176111430,"I read a journal article a while back that characterised _PERSON_ as a learning disorder where the patient cannot unlearn the psychosis, due mainly to not being able to consolidate the learning (new memories) during sleep. The patient is basically caught in a type of Groundhog Day where any unlearning of the psychosis during the day is forgotten during sleep because of a fault in the hippocampus. EMDR is forced REM sleep memory processing while awake, and thus the patient (me) can successfully unlearn the psychosis. I’ll try to find the research articles pertaining to the above explanation, but in the meantime here are some EMDR instructional videos."

176111456,"Meat isn’t inherently unhealthy. Try to say things that lift yourself up instead of putting yourself down. If you want to go vegetarian or vegan, maybe start out by giving up one kind of meat, and then working your way down the list. If you’re doing it for moral reasons, know that there isn’t anything immoral about eggs or milk. Dairy cows need to live on farms and be milked, or else they’ll go extinct. They can’t survive in the wild after 10,000 years of domestication. Same with most chickens. Buy free range/cage free if you’re worried about their living conditions. But giving it up entirely means you’ll need to take supplements to get proper nutrition, and most of the supplements aren’t as good for you as actually eating the food with the proper amino acids and vitamins. I’m allergic to meat, and I confess I still have chicken wings about once a year, and then just get sick for a day and a half after."

Idk what was going through the mind of that woman that you saw, but it could have been just that. and not something with the intention of anything else further. then again, idk other women’s intention. and then again, sometimes I do not mind chatting to someone if they start a friendly chat, in the gym. but I know that my main intention is just to do my workout–like go into workout zone. maybe she was in workout zone and did not want to talk. maybe she felt you like her and she had a bf. There could be all sorts of reasons, maybe she was not in the mood to talk. because if she is all sexy then she probably gets men saying things to her all of the time and or has had unwanted experiences. that she does not want to risk again."

He didn’t stay with it long enough to see any benefit. I think they might offer CBT at the agency I go to that includes my pdoc. I’m afraid to try though for fear it will be incredibly boring like my brother had said it was. I’d be willing to give it a shot maybe someday in the future. Have you done CBT? and if so did you notice any significant improvement?

176111540,"A lot of writers and others point to ancient human’s diets, but fail to remember that there were reasons for the high protein and high fat diets. Hunting and gathering was very labor intensive. Foraging for wild plants is as well. Man burned a lot of calories just looking for the same fuel that kept them going in order to find even more food. They traveled constantly and needed the fat. They were exposed to elements more, ergo fat to stay warm. They worked to make shelters and tools. They were always moving. We aren’t, so we have evolved to need a different, balanced diet. Our mouths are a prime example of this. Mouths are smaller than in the past so people often need wisdom tooth removal. I’m one of the people who have evolved further in this area and have no wisdom teeth. We had larger jaws meant to pulverize harder and chewier foods and more back teeth. Dometication of animals and plants made foods softer. Note, not necessarily more nutrients. Wild foods have been shown to carry more nutri
ents in some studies when the foods were analyzed. So for a true “cave man” experience, you’d have to forage and ingest the same plants and animal types available back then. The closest you can come to that is wild hunted venison, bear, elk, etc. Then forafe for qild plants and that’s difficult both in finding enough for multiple meals and for overcoming the taste profiles."

174370396,"They did worse things to their blood-brain barriers. The damage and chronic inflammation state is more pronounced. It’s not always drug induced. Sometimes they have been through some serious emotional trauma that does the same thing. Or they are just not that tolerant to stress. For example, _PERSON_’s syndrome causes a person’s skin to be thinner than usual. This probably also affects the blood brain barrier, so it becomes easier to compromise. People with _PERSON_’s syndrome have a higher likelihood of developing schizophrenia."

I’m always well dressed and clean shaven these days, but I feel like I make ‘unnatural’ movements that would make me stick out. I try my hardest to fit in. Usually I only have to fit in at the gym in the locker rooms, and standing in line at the grocery store."

176111557,Stealing no matter where you do if from is wrong. Don’t steal.
176111558,I feel like I’m surviving the days for sure. My good days seem to be just a lack of distress rather than doing any “living”. My bad days (like today) involve distress and trying to ride it out. But over the last 6 weeks I’ve had far more good days than bad days. If however you’re only barely making through your days then let your psychiatrist know. I did this and they increased my dose and things got much easier after that.
176111559,"It is difficult atm yeah… But I believe it will get easier, not easy, but easier. Thanks, how are you?"
174370393,Not me. As far as I’m aware I’m the only one in the entire history of my family tree to get schizophrenia ! Lucky me.

176111561,"I’ve experienced a lot of trauma. Last time I saw my pdoc he told me he wasn’t sure if I was misdiagnosed with sz or not and maybe it’s all just PTSD. I’m not convinced, though.

174370400,"I’ve been on zyprexa for some 13 years. I put on 4 stone after starting with it, but I’ve managed to stabilize my weight, so it’s not out of control. But the drug does make me eat more, and it might be screwing up the metabolism as well I guess. I’m only doing 5mg now. I find it’s harder to keep good weight on higher doses. I recently decided I’m going to try to switch to abilify if my doc agrees. I think a change would be good for my brain after bombarding exactly the same receptors for such a long time."

176111603,"Radical right-wing candidates frequently rely on populist and ethno-nationalist claims to mobilize support for their political campaigns. While studies have examined the predictors of radical-right support and the consequences of populism for party politics, they have not considered the effects of populist discourse on voters’ attitudes—and particularly, how populism interacts with ethno-nationalism to increase the salience of exclusionary beliefs. Using online survey experiments, we examine whether exposure to populist political claims increases outgroup antipathy in the United States. In Study 1, we randomly assign respondents to three conditions featuring vignettes constructed from existing political speeches: a morally neutral argument, populist discourse targeting political elites, and a moral critique of immigration. We then assess respondents’ sentiments toward minority groups using feeling thermometers. Our results demonstrate that exposure to populist discourse alone results in less 
favorable views of immigrants and racial minorities (as well as elites) and that this effect is only partly moderated by partisan identification. In Study 2, we use a similar design to evaluate the link between economic populism common in radical-left politics and economic nationalism: the populist condition features a critique of economic elites, the nationalist condition presents moral critiques of countries competing for U.S. jobs, and the outcome variables measure sentiments toward these countries. While economic nationalism does lead to greater chauvinism, we find no comparable effects of economic populist language. These results suggest that the observed spillover effects in Study 1 are not a result of pre-existing attitudinal associations but rather of the bundling of antielite talk with ethno-nationalism in public discourse, which has turned populism into a form of dog-whistle politics. By demonstrating that populist appeals have the capacity to activate hostility toward minority groups, our study con

176111687,I can relate. When I needed to switch jobs at the casino because I wasn’t getting along with a coworker and they wanted to make me a cashier I was so nervous I wanted to throw up. After awhile I got really good at it. Meeting new people actually became fun for me. You can do this. Pretty soon you’ll be laughing at how nervous you used to be.

176111703,"So I briefly went back to thinking that posters on forums were government intelligence workers, it didn’t help that I actually did write to someone who genuinely is the son of an NSA worker and grandson of a CIA worker. He is a public figure to some extent though has moved to the fringes of public society and deals with conspiracies which he claims to have inside knowledge about, something which his background gives credibility to, or not, depending on how you see it. My belief in the posters being government intelligence workers all seems so real and coherent when I’m believing it, and once again I wonder if I am not manifesting the reality of things with my thoughts and desires. It is however a reality which I cannot deal with for very long without becoming really dysfunctional, and the sooner I snap out of it the better. I should really stay away from the guy I wrote to, as I think getting drawn into his world would exacerbate my mental health problems. I’m back to reality now, but still f

176111710,I got sucked into the psychiatric system at an early age. I was born with severe panic disorder and manic depression. Some of the psych meds they put me on made things a lot worse for me. My first two psychiatrists were a bunch of charlatans. Thank goodness my current doctor is on the ball.
176111711,24/7 I feel like I’m in a dream. The only reason I know I’m not asleep dreaming is because when I’m asleep dreaming the dreams are either nightmares or very weird.

176111756,I am satisfied right now?:open_mouth: . I am eating vegan organic fair trade chocolate and it’s delicious. I was craving coffee for weeks because the coffees I was having were not satisfying me because of the plant based milk I was using. I had a amazingly great coffee today and enjoyed it.
176111757,I take Buspar and like it. No side effects to note.

174370439,"Personally I was able to face stressful situations better, pursue studying etc till I not started that habit long back around 15 years. Since I started that habit I find increasing tiredness, lost interest in studying and tried my best to avoid all stressful situations probably due to worsening self confidence. I think it has a major role in worsening negative symptoms in some especially who are not much social."
176111759,"Alcohol is hard to control for many. Maybe it starts out only drinking in the weekend, then every other day, then before you know it your drinking every day, and then you got a serious problem that can interfere with health, studies, job and everything really. Plus it crashes with the meds. It’s best to leave it alone if you can’t control it."
174370444,"Hey friends! I’m trying to find a career that I can actually do with sza. I was a counseling master’s student, and I had to give it up because of my illness. Then I got into a pharmacy tech program, and turns out I would have an issue with licensure because I have a psychotic disorder. Apparently nobody wants a psychotic person messing with pills… who knew? What jobs have you guys found that you find fulfilling or that pays the bills that is flexible with sza or sz?"
176111760,That’s why I’m scared that I’m worse or no better than he was.
176111761,Much less. That was compared to before sz.

176111768,sometimes I seriously wonder about you people.
176111769,I also am being followed by _PERSON_ (stake out style).
176111770,Wellbutrin and Celexa. But I’ll prolly stick to Celexa soon.
174370443,"I just started 234 mg/ml of invega sustenna and 10 mg of olanzapine (zyprexa) and I’m on 200 mg of Lamictal and I’m starting lexapro next week. Medicine is different for everyone. You have to find what works for you. Excluding haloperidol and trifluroperizine all antipsychotics have given me insomina. (Including 1000 mg of seroquel, 20 mg of abilify and even 25 mg of thorazine). Don’t give up. Medicine is needed in almost every case of schizophrenia."
176111771,"I just very loosely count calories for a general idea of the amount I should be eating to lose weight, and if I go over my daily goal by any amount, I just let it be and move on. I’m prone to eating disorders too so I definitely understand why you’d want to approach this subject with caution. I wish you luck. To be honest, I would be perfectly happy where I am now if not for health complications recently arising due to my higher weight. It sucks."
174370445,I take Clozapine. 200mg in the morning and 300mg at night. On very rare occasions I get some faint whispers.

176111775,"i think you have proper concerns, people can starve sometimes with different eating illnesses like anorexia or bulemia and these are horrendous, I think its more about finding a good balance, my balance has been interupted during this lockdown, my daily average on my exercise app has halved and maybe this is why my balance needs to be adjusted, that being said others may say i am depressed and i am a little, it is hard and that can affect the appetite too, i dont know for sure, but all i know is if i really need to eat then the survival instinct will kick in and i will eat, i’m going to grab a drink of water lol"
176111776,"I feel like I have to relearn to think more. For a long time I’ve been thinking less, using less brain activity. I think it’s the antipsychotics effects directly and indirectly."
176111777,"I’m 9 months sober and not quite clean yet. The urges are still really strong. I do AA and NA and another group for addiction in general. There’s a thing they say at AA, “There are those, too, who suffer from grave emotional and mental disorders, but many of them do recover if they have the capacity to be honest.” I feel like I’m who they are talking about. Even down to me going to AA last night and needing to leave because the hallucinations were overwhelming. I guess I don’t have a real question other than can anyone relate to this?"
176111778,"I don’t pay anything towards my meds (Invega Sustenna 100mg) Anybody with a chronic illness don’t have to pay towards their perceptions in the U.K. Perceptions can be anything from prescription toothpaste to continence aids. Or dental care. I have perfect teeth, never had a filling in 34 years because of NHS dental care that I’ve never paid for including scrape and polish. I feel sorry fo poor Americans."

174370438,You will have more side effects or new side effects by doubling your dose.
176111780,"I think the best supplement all should take daily especially if have mental, cognitive issues is Omega 3 from Fish containing plenty of DHA and EPA. Not all omega 3s are same, different brands and different types gives varied results. In my opinion the best omega 3 brand to choose is Nordic Naturals though expensive it gives highest DHA and EPA in a single soft gel. Their ultimate omega 3 series gives around 650 DHA and 450 EPA in a single soft gel and its the best. Omega 3 is best absorbed if take with fatty foods, milk is ideal one to choose."
176111781,"I know what you mean about the synchronicities and coincidences. I experience that too. I have a scenario for you: Suppose an F-1 tornado suddenly drops out of a cloud, destroys a farmer’s barn, and then dissipates. The tornado formed too fast, and was too small to be predicted on radar. Is that a random ocurrance? Things like that make me wonder if there is such a thing as randomness. Here’s another one: Suppose a soldier is in a bunker, drinking with his friends. They run out of whiskey, and one of them goes to search for another bottle. While he is gone a rocket hits the bunker and kills all the soldier’s buddies. Is that a random occurance? I don’t know. There was no virtue or courage in the soldier that saved him. As a matter of fact, it was a need for alcohol that drove him. I don’t know if these questions have any merit. I’m just speculating."
176111782,It’s when I started asking for music to help me fall asleep. (4 or 5 years old).

176111794,"So, my lungs suck. About 12 years ago, I got a nasty fungal infection in them that mimicked tuberculosis, but is much different. Once I defeated it, I was left with a nasty case of asthma. I saw a pulmonologist 2 days ago. My lung function is 42% of what someone my age, height, and weight should be. Two years ago it was 69%. One year ago, a CT scan of my chest showed a possible enlargement of my thymus that might be pressing on my lungs. My new doc wants to repeat the CT scan and compare. If that’s the case, they’ll have to crack my chest open to take it out. The large thymus theory explains the sudden change I’ve felt. I’m also getting a pulmonary function test to see how bad the asthma really is. In the meantime, I’m on a suped-up inhaler, twice a day. Anyway, my youth is gone. I’m almost 40. I’ve had my fun and adventure. I’m not going to drag this out. I will not be made to feel miserable running around with tests and appointments dominating my life. I will not lug these machine
s around with me I saw in the doctor’s office. I’m just not going to live that way. I’d rather suffocate than be led around by the nose with no hope. Sorry for the doom and gloom. In truth, I’m not gloomy about it. I’m at peace with the end possibly coming for me sooner than expected. I guess I’ve evaded the Reaper so much that I’m no longer afraid of him. Be well, and if you smoke, FFS, STOP IT!!"

176111806,Yeah they’re louder and sound almost like a real voice rather than my own thoughts
176111807,Lol oh the joy.
176111808,I’d get a second opinion. I went to a dental school. They told me I had 9 cavities. I had 4 of them filled. Then I found some reasonable dental insurance. Then I went to a regular dentist. He told me I had none. I’ve had a few cavities at one time. But I’ve never had 9 cavities at one time. That’s a huge red flag. I’d never go back to the dental school. You can get in trouble performing unnecessary dental procedures on somebody. That may not be necessarily what’s going on. But it was really weird that I could get such a difference of opinion. I’ve read reviews of dentists online It seems this stuff happens to other people.
174370455,"What’s that thing that makes you who you are? You know, that thing schizophrenia can’t define or take away from you?

176111830,"You need to contact the clinic she works for and tell them you want to file a complaint and tell them what you said in the first post. Your doctor cannot make you up meds, I learned that and I made the last pdoc I worked with, along with a group on facebook who saw her and did the same ???? to me and them, we told the clinic we were all filing a complaint, wrote it out and contacted state license board. She got investigated in our state, so she lost her ability to practice here, but I feel sorry for those that got her in IL. They moved her across state lines but she’s already getting complaints and she was canned in March. I “fired” her myself back in I want to say November and went until Jan no pdoc, but it was ok because I’ve gone off APs March 2019 and wasn’t taking anxiety meds at that point. So I got _NAME_, my new Pdoc and she told me that the old pdoc had gone into my file and made a ???? ton of additions to notes that never happened, and even said she was had it recommended if my 
husband and I split (we’ve been together 20 years, married 17, and I’m only 35 and he’s 37) that she wanted me to be completely supervised if I ever got to see my kids. _NAME_ and my therapist put in their own complaints with that one, some pdocs think they can do anything. My husband now does all doctor visits or calls with me, for a variety if reasons, but that one pdoc was the initial reason because her ?????? is now why I have lost most use of my right leg because she gave me a med I was severely allergic to, told me to take 16 benadryl a day, and upped it again. I ended in ER and the nurse there was pissed that she was wrong and purposely did an injection into my hipbone and blew the hell out of it. She has now lost her ability to work ER or do anything without direct supervision, she’s been sanctioned as we went after her and my health system said if we do this (can’t get into all of it) you’ll not bring charges against us. We had to decide but said yes but certain things had to be put into 
my chart and we made sure that was followed through. They’ve had to settle 13,000 complaints/lawsuits since Jan 2019, so we get updated by husband’s work when a new one is settled. No details, but the fact of they ?????? up again. But stand up for yourself, bring your husband with to make his own complaint if he knows she’s threatening you. You have to start the process though, and do not give her any warning you are going after her with it. It’ll give her time to screw around, and her notes should be date and time stamped, so they can see when they were added, that’ll help you go a long way. The Goddess has your back, from one to another."
176111831,"I would definitly talk to your doctor about this. Spending 90% of the time in bed is right out dangerous. I’m not trying to scare you, but you might risk getting bloodcloughing in your veins. This often happen to people who spend a lot of time in a hospital bed without getting out. You have to find a solution. Get your family to help you get motivated to make a change. If you have such bad symptoms I don’t really see that you have much to lose by trying a new medication. Try to incorporate blood thinning herbs in your diet so you stay safe."
176111832,"I’ve been lucky so far, but yeah, it’s time for me to upgrade"

174370456,"First, I haven’t noticed that Amyloban 3399 causes or relieves depression in all of the time I’ve been using it. Second, I take the Wellbutrin because for some reason I have a problem with suicidal ideation when I’m not on it. Neither my Geodon, the Amyloban or my Sarcosine do anything for that. The Wellbutrin makes the suicidal thoughts go away and also puts a bit of pep in my step. Third, I started taking the Amylobann as I heard it helped with positive symptoms. It does, I’m now down to a maintenance dose of Geodon, which is how I like it. The fewer APs you can get by on, the better. Fourth, a surprise benefit of Amyloban is that it helps with nerve pain, which is good because I took damage to my back, neck, and right side in an explosion in my youth. The Amyloban has helped so much that I was able to stop using Vicodin for chronic pain relief, which is a phookin’ big deal because that’s some addictive crap that no one needs in their life. Vicodin withdrawal is just vile, by the way. 
Fifth, the extent to which you’re examining the meds I’m taking is vaguely stalkerish. Just sayin’."
176111836,I get sick to my stomach as if I’d just smoked my first cigarette. They usually argue about their food preparation and it makes me not want to eat. End of rant.

176111838,"for me, voices are an element that became part of us. But for me, voices came to my life was due to the rejections and denials that i had in my life. the voices were the manifestation of these feelings and emotions that were so strong that it “felt” real and became what it was to me at that time. To me, voices do not dictates me nor am i what it said. It’s just like what i said, it was manifested from the emotions and feelings of rejections that were so strong that it became “something”, something that we called voices."
176111839,"I got rejected a lot at the beginning when approaching girls in nightclubs until one night a girl and her friend came talk to me. I had my eye on the blond one and we talked about what we do in life etc at the end she approached me and we started to dance, at the end I asked her phone number. After a week of texting she invited me to a party so I drove there with her. After the party she told me you can sleep at my house, so I did lol My parents were mad that I didn’t sleep at home that night."

174370466,"When you get to be middle/late middle aged (as I am) the acute ‘positive’ symptoms can often fade, and negative symptoms dominate. In terms of help and support that’s not good, as the focus in terms of help and support is heavily focussed on those with acute,positive symptoms . Coping well with occasional periods of acute and debilitating symptoms trumps constantly functioning at a non acute, below average level. That is the situation in the UK. Family support is then crucial. The trouble being not all have that family support."
174370457,"I wish I could stop blaming the illness but it seems its the thing to blame. My psychiatrist approves me and wrote on my report: sz with negative symptoms, apathy and avolition."

I did earn a 25 dollar amazon giftcard for a survey site I do that the Capalyta makers asked what I thought of a certain commercial they were going to put out, so I got to get paid to tell them what ???? their product was.

176111851,Excersise is a great way to stress down. Like jog or use a ellipse machine for 30 minues two times a week or more can make the body feel balanced. I recently started myself and it has a serious impact on relieving stress and anxiety. If you dare to try it for a couple of weeks you will see. Ellipse is good if you are overweight like me. It is gentle on knees and leggings. I bought a machine to have at home. Good investment it seems.

176111860,maybe its not the negative syptoms .
176111861,They won’t. They already made their determination so you’re all set. If you have paranoid sz I think it’s kicking in. Maybe call your dr
176111862,I am so happy today. It isn’t fair on the others. Some day you will learn the right thing to do. It’s called experience.
176111863,Oh well. I would probably be dead if not for APs.
176111864,Good job man! That’s awesome looks good!

174370474,"I found out that I still had memory and cognitive problems even after stopping meds for a year. Cognitive symptoms like bad memory are part of schizophrenia, the third symptoms category. I pretty much think they’re permanent, maybe from the brain shrinking caused by schizophrenia. There is no meds for cognitive symotoms of sz because there isn’t for dementia and Alzheimer either."
176111869,I know the feeling however sometimes people don’t understand what they don’t themselves experience … im learning not to let such comments get to me …
176111870,"Hi, i just recently returened to work after my 10 weeks of hospitalization, im on haldol depot 70.52mg, quetiapine 300mg, depakote 1000mg and trixephenidyl 6mg daily. So my mania and psychosis have completely gone and i knew that 100mg quetiapine made me drowsy in the morning but i went with it (i take 200mg at night). So i got ready for work (i work as a barista), put on jeans, nice silk shirt and adidas shoed and took my morning medication: depakote, trixephenidyl and quetiapine. When i turned to work quetiapinr started to makr me super drowsy that i could barely make sense of all the orders i was receiving, i was sweating a lot because my employers are saving up on air con. I could barely stand and every cup looked such an effort i felt like if i was woken up in the middle of the night and was forced to work. I started complaining after 2 hours and managed to get a break (10mins for eating and smoking), but town centre was busy so i couldnt relax and i returned to work, i was so drowsy and tired 
that i could barely stand and my colleagues offered to let me go home early, but surprise surprise! After 5 hours of extreme drowsiness and jugging tons of coffee i got a little better and now they said i have to stay. When i said to my boss employers that i could barely stand because of medication - he laughed! Imagine, im working fot a company that focuses on handicapped people at work and i received almost no help today ( besides another smoke break). I am considering quitting or reducing to 20hrs a week. This day was hell to me, so my mom called the clinic and asked if i should be taking off quetiapine in the morning and she said that i can, so ill see how i feel tomorrow."

176111873,I think speed reading is not the answer here.
176111874,"yessssssssssssssssss, to offen to much."
176111875,For me it’s really dificult to defend myself in an argument because my mind goes slower than the other person’s mind. So the other person wins.
176111876,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ !!!
176111877,Weed and _PERSON_ don’t mix at all. Try not to do it again. You could lose control totally and end up doing stuff that could cause you to regret it.
176111878,I’ll be dead before I can see my pdoc.

You’re a lovely woman, I bet with some continued effort you’ll have a chance to make more friends. Friends are hard right now especially because of the pandemic. I don’t have any friends in real life, only on the internet. I come here every day to be social. It’s three closest I get to conversation."
176111884,Discontent at the moment. Not happy with the new home.
176111885,Wheel of Time sounds intetesting. Also 7 books sounds good
176111886,"_AT_MENTION_ ok. I am on 200 mg modafinil now, new dosage, double. Good to know. What started happening for you? I am having visual hallucinations, anxiety, rocking, fear. Pdoc also gave me Vyvanse a while back (for binge eating & increase activity I think?). Currently 70mg. At first it helped energy like this but wore off. Vyvanse continues to help me socially for whatever reason."
174370479,"So I was a guitarist studying jazz at the university of Toronto in my third year when all the sudden right after I started smoking copious amounts of weed I increasingly got more and more sick. Fast forward three months I was incarcerated and thrown into a mental hospital. I was put on Invega sustenna and 2 weeks later I was basically positive symptom free. Ever since returning home and seeing my psychiatrist every month they keep saying that I’m going to get back to my old self because I have a really good prognosis. I’m always asking stuff like do other patients you see become happy and live normal lives and there like “ all the time “. Truth is I want to live the life of an artist, I always have but ever since being put on this drug My life has been very low quality. I switched to Abilify 4 months ago and believe that I’ll be able to handle a low dose of it in the future but right now I struggle with depression (that I never had before), no sexual energy or ability to connect to anythi
ng, anhedonia, lack of motivation, no emotions, poor motor skills ( so I can’t play guitar ), feeling of being drugged up, cognitive problems etc. I’m just so far from the person I used to be so I wonder how they think I’m going to get back to 100% _NAME_. Are they lying? I can see how if I were to go off the drugs completely I would get back to myself for sure but Idk if I’ll be able to do that. They want me to be on drugs for 2 years and then go off of them and see how I do, they say nothing about my psychosis leads to the idea I have schizophrenia but I can’t help think that I‘ probably do and if I do then I probably won’t be able to get back to myself. It’s been a year since my episode and they say it’s a long process for getting back to myself that takes years but idk I’m just confused. Any insight?"
176111887,"Me, too. Also family or having someone say stuff to you that contradicts the truth really bring you down. I hear you- things are so hard when you believe yourself to be a fraud. How are you dealing with this nowdays?"

176111889,"In your mind , what is hell?"
176111890,I said before i escaped the simulation. They let me escape or took me out of the sim. Showed me stuff. Aliens. Told me they thought i was _NAME_ titor. Past life stuff. I went to millions or more different simulations and timelines. Ive seen reptilians and greys and other things.
176111891,"That is very interesting. So men and women experienced roughly the same level of symptoms after 10 years, but women were more likely to be living independently with a partner. That basically tracks with what we see here. Sexism is brutal to disabled men."
174370481,"Sounds pretty good _NAME_. I just take low stress jobs that do not pay much as that is all I can handle. My 80’s were spent recovering from two psychotic episodes. I am tending to forget a lot now, but my hobby gives my mind something to think about."
176111892,It’s a problem. I too have had loose stool and problems where you have to crap straight away or your crapping your pants. Got better with dosage but it’s a serious problem. Talk to your shrink. It’s one of those things your least likely to talk about but so important for your health!
176111893,I fell in love with _NAME_. I still think about him having not seen him in 20+ years
176111894,I was on it for years. Got off it last year and on latuda. My personal experience with it was not good. Things didn’t really get better on it.
176111895,"tbh idk what is worse, the effects of Covid or the effects of Lockdown, what is the real killer going on here?"

176111898,"Yeah, I experienced all that too, including the TV thing, but not since being on my meds."
174370477,I’ve improved dramatically since onset. I can meet or beat neurotypicals in functioning at work. I can pass for normal for extended periods when I need to. Meds and therapy are key.
176111899,Thanks for the confirmation.

174370478,I see a nurse practitioner and shes great. She provides all of my prescriptions and ones she cant fill (Clozaril) she gets the head psychiatrist to send to the pharmacy. Shes very kind and understanding
176111901,"I’m going to think my way out of hell,"
176111902,She found a better job. I’m used to it. At least she was there for a couple of years. I just want a caseworker that cares.

176111904,Author Journalist
176111905,"I know you didnt ask, but if youre interested in my unsolicited advice, my biggest key to a good interview is to interview them after they interview you. Have a list of questions ready and after they are done asking you questions, or going with a natural conversational flow if its that type of interview, ask questions about the job. The only time I didnt get a job after an interview was after my first interview ever as a teenager, but after that I realized that asking about the job shows interest and drive. A lot of people focus on answering everything right, but asking questions and interviewing them can be a good save from an awkward interview. Obviously I dont take up an hour of their time, but I find about 5 questions pertaining to the job is enough. Its my favorite way to ease the tension of a stressful interview. I hope it goes well!"
176111906,Im usually the same with the same voices and all but lately its been abit better im not sure why but i have been sitting out the front on the verandah it makes me feel more social even tho im not really socializing but i do wave or say hello to neighbors sometimes and i think it makes me feel i could go to them for help if someone did try to “get” me.
176111907,I went off Invega without tapering. Detoxxed for 6 months and then went on Aristada with no problems. The negatives from Invega were awful and took a while to get rid of.
176111908,My first language was German but I forgot it unfortunately. I now speak Swedish and English. I live in Australia. I have been complimented for my accent. I have been told I have a beautiful accent by a stranger. He was a Australian man in South Australia when I lived there. I don’t know what kind of accent I have. My mum has a British accent. Not sure if I have a ozi accent. Some say I do some say I don’t.
176111909,"If you don’t need treatment, that means you’re now fine which means you’re no longer disabled"
176111910,"I’ve wondered if that’s my proper diagnosis. I’ve done really well since I’ve been diagnosed, but it could just be good meds and behavior. What does dx stand for?"
176111911,"I’m on SSDI - permanent disability. The thing is, I was already on my (ex) husband’s plan through his work when I became eligible for Part B, and his plan covered more for less than medicare, so I declined it. If the Covered California workers (3 of them) and my old HMO HR employer had been better informed, I would have Medicare with no penalty each month. But because they told me since I turned it down when first offered, I would have to pay a ‘huge’ penalty for every year I didn’t have it- each month -for as long as I had it! I only learned last year that in a case like mine- loosing coverage through divorce, I had 3 months to switch to medicare without incurring a penalty. My track record for calling/going in person to ‘fix’ something like this, I doubt I will ever see a dr. again. How am I doing off meds? It’s a daily struggle, and I’d have to agree that I did better on them."
176111912,"I remember when she was 3 years old I found her in the bathroom holding the kitten under the hot water in the bathtub. I took her to mental health to have her evaluated for whatever might be wrong with her, I should have known then, but she had ADHD so it got all confused with that. Then in 5th grade when we had her evaluated for her IEP the school Psychologist was talking to me and I said well at least she’s not a sociopath and he didn’t say anything, and I said oh she is and he said well there’s a spectrum. And when on to explain the spectrum to me. That’s how I first heard my daughter may be a sociopath. It was scary."

176111936,Those “normies” often stalk me because they think they prove; no one deserves any rights but them. I think they’re unbelievably dense.
176111937,Eh they really sucks. It shouldn’t be like that. Have you tried the UK and Canada?
174370482,My fitness is good if I keep it regular. If I don’t then of course my fitness level goes down. Like normies too. The difference is my motivation can be much lower so that may be a reason why physical performance could be impaired?

176111941,I find that naturally I need 11-12 hours of sleep to function at my best. This was true even when I was off meds. I dream vividly and often constantly during this time. I spend literally half my life in my dreams. Crazy. Maybe you can find a med that is less sedating. Either that or get to liking coffee!!

I was in and out of inpatient hospitals like a revolving door all of that time, always for suicidal ideations. On a million AD’s and mood stabilizers and nothing worked. Then, in 2005, I got God, no. 1. No. 2, I fell out of love with my ex husband overnight. No. 3, my father apologized to me for his incest of me when I was a child. All of these things happened in 2005. After that year, my depression disappeared forever, never to return."

I’m pretty stable on the meds I’m using now, and have no serious side effects. I guess that’s whats most important."

174370487,"I have worked it out now. I will reverse all these deficits in the next 3 months. I write regarding this so that others may use the same techniques to alleviate their concerns. Everyone has a certain potential. Outside of that, the brain is completely plastic. I realised during three days of flow that doing something new, like creating sentences using obscure words, I could improve my ability to recall information, increase my auditory attention span, and improve my ability to pay attention or notice things. There were 5-10 percent improvements in all these aspects. Memory recall may have improved by 20 percent. It takes work, but it is quite possible that those deficits that seemed not possible to mitigate will completely go away. My therapist was destroying the brain by asking me to basically do nothing. For the past three years. The Psychiatrist is correct. I have also noticed an improvement in reading. Now, I will try to make three sentences using the same word. Afterwards, six. I am becoming m
ore eloquent. These sentences make me think, reason, doubt, and come out with innovative ideas. I also get to question the order of words in a sentence. Then I will make paragraphs while using arcane words. In each of the sentence in a paragraph I will use the same word. In other words, I will improve my step-wise learning ability. I don’t lie regarding the improvements in the Executive Functions. The issue with Algorithmic Learning is that it will further decrease Step-Wise encoding ability. It is a way to cope, but not recommended. First of all, doing something innovative is essential for this deficit to reverse. Also, it is important to think, reason, doubt, and question. This would build the Executive Functions fast. I find it imperative to include all these aspects in order to be able to revive my brain. Making new sentences may seem a trivial way, but I am finding it to be very effective. It is important to find the correct medication combination. Positive and Negative symptoms of Schizophrenia destro
y the brain. A person is a slave to his symptoms. Bipolar Disorder in itself is no less. When these two illnesses combine, I think it is the worst possible combination after DID. Treating the symptoms, if one is fortunate enough, can bring back cognitive decline with a lot of effort. If the symptoms remain untreated, then it is not possible to reverse cognitive decline. I will use my verbal reasoning ability to enhance my nous for Mathematics. It is counter- intuitive, but it has to be a creative act. Otherwise, I do Mathematics and I lose it. I can’t think of a better way than this right now. Of course, there are other ways like solving crossword puzzles, playing chess, etc. In my view, though, this comes first, and then the other things may replenish the brain faster. This may be partly due to the fact that the Procedural memory needs to keep collecting new information in order to nullify the deficits in neural coding. If my thinking is correct, this would be the better route. I will forget the GRE. I nee
d to revive my brain first. I am headstrong in my opinions and methods. If this doesn’t work after awhile I will let you guys know. Other techniques may be applied, then."

This type of underground favoritism was also said to be exhibited by Freemason believing themselves to be an elite group of ‘enlightened ones’ who would identify to others by hosting an image of the Eye of Providence in their store fronts.

Blasphemy was my biggest fear and concern brought on me by either God or aliens… I would wake up in the psychiatric ward and had terrible fear, paranoia, and experienced death a thousand times over. Luckily, it stopped. I don’t know what they call it in catholicism but it felt like Limbo or Purgatory. I used to be an Atheist but became Christian out of fear. I still believe. I feel like the whole Blasphemy thing is a Catholic thing and not a non-denominational thing. I really don’t know, but you’d have to talk to a Biblical doctor or Theologist in my opinion."

174370513,"Uh, I don’t want to bug you but it could get much worse. I’ve somehow found the energy to work for almost entirely the past 36 years. I got diagnosed at age 19 and didn’t work for the following 3 years as I toured the hospitals and group homes and graced them with my wonderful presence. But I got back to work when I was 22 or 23 and I’ve been working almost steadily since. My sister is a high energy person but I was about average. I inherited my dads love for outside, physical work so I had some labor jobs and handled them fine. I also had a friends and a pretty good social life. But 4 years ago I made a strategic error when I was about 54 and living in a board & care home. I started isolating. It was a choice. I mingled with people during the day and I had a car and went places but for four years I hardly went out past dinnertime. I was sharing a small room and my roommate stayed in it most of the day when I wanted space and the room to myself. He stayed up all night and slept all day and 
it was frustrating. But he had a girlfriend and he left after dinner to be with her or his other friends or watched basketball on TV in the TV room so I had the room to myself after dinner. That was my downfall. I thought I enjoyed relaxing with my computer most nights while my roommate was gone and I got alone time just to think without any outside interference. Thinking was a a luxury to me. During my 38 years with the disease and a hectic drug addiction I just rushed around mindless because of schizophrenia and the daily pursuit of crack and when I finally got clean I made some pretty big strides in my recovery. The end result was that I finally got the peace of mind I had so craved since I first got sick. I turned 50 and started branching out in my thinking and became curious about the world around me and the people in it. It was a revelation and I still treasure that. Anyways, I discovered I had stuff to say about life and my life and other subjects. But I took it too far and I ended up staying home too 
much and though I was in OK shape and healthy until I was 50, I started getting a lot of ailments and I started losing my unused muscles and my energy. And I started suffering from fatigue. I have managed to hang on to my current janitor job for 5 years but I work about half the speed I used to and after lunch I’m so tired it feels like I’m drunk and just so tired. I started walking a few times at my sisters mobile home park. I’m trying to make it into regular thing. But yeah, I can manage my job satisfactorily to my employers but I am so tired. And I still lay down too much. I haven’t given up. I get around, I’m always going to doctors appointments and other errands and I force myself to go out at night but this post is a warning about the side effects of isolation. All you youngins out there take heed. What you put into getting healthy in your youth will determine your life 5 or 10 years down the road. You will get what you put into it.

out consciously doing things like walking or going to a gym or hiking etc your health may stay the same for 5 or 10 years but after that when you get in your forties and 50’s if you didn’t exercise it will go downhill, I guarantee it. The solution is obvious to everybody. Factor in the sedation of AP’s, a bad diet, doing drugs or drinking, isolating and a sedentary life and it’s serious. But not hopeless. It’s within your power and control to make changes for most people to stay healthy. But like I said, good health will not strike you magically when you’re in your home. You have to pursue it."

To me this understanding seems like an honorific applied to believers so that they are given better regard than non-believers. But it doesn’t mean they are completely honest and truthful all the time though, as if everything a believer does is of the highest order all the time. The Messianic / Demoniacal extreme beliefs are just religious psychosis amplified by mania, depending on stress level (high stress lends itself to the demoniacal extremes, and low stress to messianic.) A level head doesn’t think of such extremes."

I still have a resting heart rate of 100 (it was 150 when I was on the medication) but other than that most of the issues subsided when I got off of it. I had 20/20 vision my whole life. Other than _NAME_’s syndrome in my left eye and a lazy eye, my eyes were great. Within a few months of Seroquel, my eyesight started to blur and I had to get glasses. Increasingly over a few years, I developed a blind spot in my left eye (opposite side of the _NAME_’s). Even after getting off the medication a few years ago my script continues to get worse every year and the blind spot has now eliminated half the vision in one of my eyes. It’s really scary because no specialist can tell me what’s happening and they never seem concerned about it. Literally my visual field tests are half empty, I’ve just lost vision. Because th
ere was a correlation between this beginning and Seroquel, could one be caused by the other? Just wondering if anyone has experienced eye issues from meds or if they are probably unrelated. Thanks in advance! Sorry for being longwinded I just wanted some opinions."

176112278,"The problem is you can’t possibly know if it is delusional or not, because that’s how ‘delusions’ are. You’re going about the wrong way if you ask others what is or is not delusional because even their perspective is subject to being subjective and flawed. The point is, it’s up to you to decide. By asking others in the manner that you are, is almost destroying your sense of self-trust. It’s a better idea to be flexible than be sold on anything as 100% true. By taking someone else’s perspective, you don’t have a foundation for self-trust. But by being flexible you can still have self-trust but remain open to new ideas/opinions. If you went to a doctor and asked for a 100% accurate opinion on a diagnosis? Not even they can offer you an accurate answer. Many people get second opinions and even those can change. If what you’re wanting is a lack of anxiety? Then you’re going to have to swallow a pill of certainty and throw personal growth out the window. It’s your choice. Or is i

176112287,"From what I heard, most industrialized countries generally give more vacation time than the U.S. Read that a long time ago. I accumulate about two hours of vacation time every two week payday. It works out to about 60 hours a year or about 12 days. I ain’t complaining, it’s the first job I’ve gotten paid vacation. Also get sick pay, about one hour every two weeks. At the end of the year, if you didn’t use all your vacation, it rolls over to the new year. You lose the unused sick pay though. Also we can cash in our vacation days anytime during the year, as much as we have saved up. One perk I’ve used three times in seven years is we are allowed “mental health days”. I don’t know how many I get but it is almost my favorite bonus. Not to mention a free debit card that we can use to pay at certain medical facilities. Also for parking costs. Medicare pays almost all my medical costs but I pay about $2.00 per prescription for about half my 10 medications and I can use this card to pay tha

Also, if a person with a psychotic disorder is not getting sleep their symptoms will become much worse and it can trigger an episode. From personal experience, I actually stopped having major episodes once I was out of the lower education system and could sleep in, getting the amount of sleep my body needed. Though it did not completely remove my symptoms. Thus sleep is not a cure for psychosis, but it can certainly have drastic effects on it and the two are very related."

They don’t tell you to use drugs or get off drugs. Its just about being with and supporting each other who have the same non-ordinary perceptions and experiences. We also don’t tell you that you need to be hospitalized.
176112368,"Sorry, Is this about the duality in existence?"
176112369,Some people are very happy not hearing / watching anything about death thank you very much! I’m one of those people and have been since I was young. It doesn’t mean I’m any more worried about dying than the average person. There’s no way I’d watch a program about an undertaker.
176112370,I posted something I regret last night Wanted to apologise for it. Sometimes I despair at my situation and I don’t know the answer or what options I have left
176112371,"Do you have insurance? My insurance paid for nicotine patches and I used patches, gum and lozenges to quit. I know that seems excessive but that’s what it took. I just made sure to scrub my arm with a washcloth to exfoliate so the patch would stick really, really well to get that nicotine to go into my system better and at first I used the gum, then I tried the lozenges and liked those better, the mini ones. You should try it. If I can do it, anyone can do it."
176112372,I have been symptomatic before drinking… I take a nap genius I will be symptomatic tomorrow. I hate how you’ve derailed my thread…!

176112379,If you take too many antibiotics don’t they stop working eventually? Wouldn’t that put you at more risk to die?
176112380,Thank you for explaining more _AT_MENTION_. It’s good that you’re willing to share your experience to warn others.

176112390,"I was in a car accident which led to a slipped and rotated disc in the mid back position. Even taking in a tiny breath was agonizing, so I could not yell out for help after they put me on a stretcher in the hallway. They left me there for nine hours. Then they took me for x-rays and yanked up my shoulders to put an x-ray plate under my back. I screamed. Then they gave me a funny look as though I should be in tip top shape. Hours later, the doc came over and told me I was being checked out because the x-rays said that there was nothing wrong with me. They got my x-rays mixed up with someone elses. So for some time I was crawling around my apartment on my hands an knees. Eventually I sat in a chair, grabbed one chair arm, and yanked myself in one direction to re-rotate the disc back to they way it should be oriented. After that I could at least stand up. But the disc was still poking out. So I leaned back on a wooden back _NAME_ that one uses to keep ones back curved as it should be. That popped it b
ack in place, but it kept popping out again on a daily basis. So onto the treadmill I got to re-strengthen my back. It took 3 years to get the disc to stay put. I hate doctors."

I’ve had access to the internet most of my young life, and have absorbed so many lessons about science, logic, and media that its hard not to feel like I’m at least above average, but honestly, I feel like I’m looking into an ocean and light stops reflecting back. Intelligence higher then mine probably hides its features from the average observer. Self selecting how its seen only to be understood and propagated by a strata of knowledgeable experts that know eachother through connections I can’t make. I’m probably just average."

It makes me nervous. I pray one day I will be fine. If it is the last day of my life I don’t want a panic or anxiety attack. People judging my thoughts but need to be left alone if I am ever going to get better. A few people think I am or my thoughts are immoral but what gives? Afraid of going to the hospital. And talking to people in my mind. Judged on thoughts but not my own. I am picked on by others thinking they know my thoughts and feelings. How do I get people out of my mind and body? Someone suggested an epson salt bath but I don’t have a bath tub. How do people get inside my body in the first place? They can hurt me with out being in the same room. Need to cleanse my body and mind. I am afraid sounding and looking like a racist and pervert to people. I used to be much better before. Darn those celebrities.

174370579,I second this. I believe in our ability to chose meds or not because they have some strong side effects. I recently came off abilify and remeron and did so slowly and had little withdrawals. I dont suggest doing it all at once like I did though especially with how many you’re on.

Once you start, you just have to make the most of what you have and do you absolute best to push through. You should hopefully feel valued and feel quite normal even if always tired. It’s great to be in work and have some sort of self independence. You shall, hopefully be okay! Pace yourself and figure out and manage your stressors; medication does not and will not fix everything. Maybe invest in some weights so that you have fitness and stamina on your side; it also does good for your mental health. Take walks as much as you can. It will help."
176112429,"_PERSON_ is interesting, but I always preferred _NAME_ for sci fi ideas. The talking animals, the last battle with the Saracens (a little racist, but hey I’m Cypriot and preoccupied with the Turks according to international law), but the best bit was the wardrobe which later became the TARDIS in Doctor Who, the first episode of which pitched the metal and genetic slime Daleks against the natural and forest dwelling Thals. Doctor Who never got any better than the first episode, but I was wondering for a long time why they chose a woman for the latest Doctor, seeing it as just another CIA plot to discredit the whistle blowers like _NAME_ (though I’m sure she acted of her own free will). I always wanted to be the Doctor as a child, and I have finally realised that my future lies as a woman, either through medicine in this life, some 900 years in the future or through reincarnation when I return from the seven heavens of the after life. Why, because to create a child all of your own without the aid 
of anyone else is perhaps the highest achievement. Women really are superior in this respect, having gone through the pains of childbirth for their aims at becoming truly independent and self-serving. This is something doubtless I will have to experience as well if I want to achieve such a noble aim. But some might say it is selfish and an affront to the natural order. We are humans after all, not dragons. I hope that no one takes offence, for me, a TARDIS/Wardrobe and talking animals (real animals like you find in the zoo) remain my desire, somewhere, sometime, and somehow, they already exist, I’m just too broke to afford them."

174370592,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Animal-assisted therapy for schizophrenia and related disorders: A systematic review. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, Journal of psychiatric research , May 2019 16 Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is increasingly researched as a potential treatment for physical and mental illness, including schizophrenia. The aim of the current paper is to systematically review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness of AAT for schizophrenia and related disorders. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, CAB Abstracts, and Web of Science for RCTs of AAT for schizophrenia and related disorders. Primary outcomes were mental state and behaviour, clinical global response, and quality of life and wellbeing. Studies were eligible if they were RCTs that had compared AAT, or other animal-assisted intervention, to any control group using any participants with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia (or related disorder), regardless of age, gende
r, setting, or severity and duration of illness. Seven studies were identified for the review. _NAME_-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of studies, including marked differences in outcome measures and interventions. Five out of seven studies included symptoms as an outcome measure, with one reporting improvements in negative symptoms and one study reporting improvements in positive and emotional symptoms. The remaining studies reported no significant effects of AAT. Three studies included quality of life as an outcome measure but did not find any significant effects. Two studies did, however, report improvements in various measures of self-view. The use of AAT for schizophrenia remains inconclusive and there is currently not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions due to heterogeneity of studies, risk of bias, and small samples. Rigorous, large-scale RCTs are needed to assess the true impact of AAT on schizophrenia."

174370607,"Yale School of Medicine When researchers listen to people who hear voices The line between mental illness and genius has long been known to be razor-thin. Yale researchers stumbled upon evidence of this fragile boundary while researching auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia. https://medicine.yale.edu/news/yale-medicine-magazine/when-researchers-listen-to-people-who-hear-voices/ So I just read this and find it interesting because I do find this open (less in fear) way of thinking has been extremely helpful for me ( although I know not everyone believes in such things) . I started using the voices to work through things (fears, insecurities, holding onto to pain, judgement, anger and other peoples options and drama…that was everything clouding the truth of anything that I was hearing. ) I just stopped fighting with the voice and when they say something bad - I’d think about (if that had been a silly fear) then I’d tell them that (that’s not my truth) so I won’t be having that thought an
ymore…it seemed to work. I eventually started thinking about what I put into my senses on a normal day and cut out anything negative or triggering while I retrained my head with more positive stuff ( I know many here have done that too). I did my best to fill my off time with things that inspired, motivated, self help or just positive experiences (any step in the right direction was my theme) . It wasn’t easy at first, especially when I didn’t want to leave the house in the beginning. But the more you do it the easier and more natural it becomes, because you just feel better over time. These are just a few of the many things that have helped me, and I hope will help you guys too."
174370614,"I hate to be negative but excuse me if I’m a little skeptical. I’ve heard this claim from many different people and there always seems to be some kind of disclaimer that the person lists. The most common one is, “I’m completely cured but I still need medication”. Or, “I made a full recovery but I just have negative symptoms.” OR, you see someone claim they’ve been cured and two months down the road they relapse. I don’t wish bad things on anybody but when someone says they have zero symptoms it seems like there’s always a catch."

174370626,"Hi Laetitia, On the face of it, what you say is correct. However, what I say is correct, too. Based on what I say, plainly we as a society should be all over EGLN genes and HIF1a in schizophrenia research. Also, whilst there is no OMIM on EGLN, I did find the following paper after I concluded it was probably very significant: ‘Altered DNA methylation associated with a translocation linked to major mental illness.’ And I also only found this paper after I wrote to the authors, too, pointing out the link between EGLN genes and DISC1. Call me paranoid. Another point being that the hypoxia you mention is one of the few causal factors we know about for schizopnrenia. In other words, hypoxia is a cause of schizopnrenia. Yes, Marfan disorder is a connective tissue disorder. There is also research on the greater prevalence of connective tissue disorders in schizopnrenia. High proline is found in schizopnrenia. Proline is produced by ALDH18A1 via PYCR1 and both these genes are associated with connective 
tissue disorders assoicated with elastin i.e. cutis laxa with joint laxity. P4HA2 is procollagen proline oxoglutarate. It acts on proline and it is, as the name suggests, essential to collagen, which is the problem in connective tissue disorders like Elhers Danlos. P4HA2 is one of the genes with most significant altered function in EGLN3 silencing. PYRC1 performs the opposite function to PRODH which is a gene linked to schizopnrenia and is part of the 22q11 deletion region functional for schizopnrenia. And P4HA2 happens to be located at 5q31.1, which is a location where multiple other genes are located that happen carry SNPs that are associated or significantly associated with schizopnrenia in Irish high density schizophrenia families. I did not find the paper you mentioned, but it would be interesting to know the basis of the reasoning that Marfan syndrome with schizopnrenia as a comorbidity is probably misdiagnosed _PERSON_. But even without the Mir190a link to EGLN3 and the Marfan gene, what I say is very 
compelling, I think."

Instead, the focus is to use advanced diagnostic imaging and technologies such as patient specific organoid ‘minibrains’ to more specifically target the development of therapeutic drugs tailored to the patient’s unique symptoms.

I waited a very long time when I was really at the last limit. Fortunately my first experience with psychiatry did not end in a hospital. I had very strong ideas about psychiatry. Commonly, mad people here (as in almost all other countries) are frowned upon. And I was imagining horrible things if I had to hang out with sick people and going to hospitals.

174370668,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Benzodiazepine use among older adults with schizophrenia spectrum disorder: prevalence and associated factors in a multicenter study. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, AS Seigneurie and _PERSON_, International psychogeriatrics , May 2019 07 ABSTRACTObjectives:Data on psychotropic medications of older patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder are scarce. Specifically, information about the use of benzodiazepines among older patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder is very limited. Because benzodiazepine use in older patients has been associated with many disabling side effects, its use in actual practice must be described and questioned. This study aimed at exploring the prevalence of benzodiazepine use and the clinical factors associated with such use among older patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder.Data from the Cohort of individuals with Schizophrenia Aged 55 years or more (CSA) were used to examine the prevalence of benzodiazepine use among older patients with sc
hizophrenia spectrum disorder. Demographic and clinical characteristics associated with benzodiazepine prescription were also explored.The prevalence of benzodiazepine use was 29.8% of older patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. These patients were significantly more likely to have medical comorbidities, cognitive and social functioning impairments, to report a lifetime history of suicide attempt, to be institutionalized, and to have been hospitalized in a psychiatric service in the past year compared to those without a benzodiazepine prescription (all p<0.05). There were no between-group differences in schizophrenia severity and psychiatric comorbidity.Although it can be hypothesized that benzodiazepine prescription is part of a short-term therapeutic strategy toward patients with more severe trouble or comorbid disorders, our results suggest a strong link between benzodiazepine prescription and a particularly vulnerable subpopulation of older patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder."

Believe your doctor that you are handling it well and don’t give in to the doubt if you want to stay out. Try to see your doctor or therapist once a week for a while.

It was agonizing and I wanted to escape, but they made me do it anyway. Faith is a personal journey and it should never be forced. I chose my own faith later in life. Please, please do not stop seeking help. SZ/SZA often come from trauma…and the abusers forget about what they did to us. My teachers and my classmates are probably doing their own thing and living happily by now.

174370678,"my schizophrenia was very much tied to my development. My adolescent and teenage years, and development based traumas were influential in my mental illness. So naturally psychosis had a big impact on my development. Would u say it’s different for you?? It sounds like we all can experience similar things but in different steps and stages based upon environment. But you didn’t experience schizophrenia until a little bit later I recall?? Maybe for me my psychosis was always very introverted because I had not developed my self and as a result of schizophrenia even worse. But since you were moreso developed before you experienced symptoms much, you had a confidence I didn’t have. Which got you in trouble sometimes coupled with psychosis. Because you may have been “inappropriate” to an extent. I was inappropriate too but I always tied it to “development” in my head. When really I was suffering from schizophrenia. So it’s all pretty much the same but I’d say environment influences how ps

But last month I had to call my pdoc and leave a message that I had walgreens request on 3 dates, they told me walgreens never sent so they had to call walgreens and chew em out.

176112790,"They’ve been in my dreams a lot lately. Tormenting me trying to make me miserable. But I’ve been kicking their asses honestly. Sometimes I’ve even seen them scared cursing at me. I’m a lot stronger now, I think too strong for them. But that one voice I keep thinking is the devil continues to mess with my head. He threatens me. He says he could ruin me in an instant. He could take everyone I loved away. He even paused for a bit and then, I swear I could feel him sneering, said instead he’d just make my boyfriend leave me for another girl. Wouldn’t I love THAT? God says not to be afraid and not to listen to his threats but it just gives me anxiety because if he is the devil whose to say he can’t do those things? And when I told him “God wouldn’t let you do those things to me” he said, again sneering, “Are you sure? He’s already let me do quite a lot to you.” That one really hurt me. I hate him so much. It’s not fair I can hear demons. I don’t want to anymore. Most of the 
time now I can’t but on occasion like now I do. They say that now my mental illness is being treated my energy isn’t as negative so I’m just not on the “same wavelength” as them to hear them as much anymore. But they’re still there and very much want me back in that place of suffering. Want to pull me in and not let go. They really do scare me a lot. But I stand up to them because I’m brave and I’m strong and someone has to do it. Horrible horrible entities I wouldn’t wish interactions with them on anyone."

Participants were supplemented with L-theanine (250 mg/day) along with their current medication for 8 consecutive weeks. The cognitive functions and related symptoms were evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after L-theanine supplementation using advanced version (21-items) of the _NAME_ Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-21), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), inclu

STAI test results indicated a significant decrease in Anxiety-trait scores (P = 0.012) after L-theanine supplementation. PSQI scores also decreased in the unremitted patients at baseline after L-theanine intake (P = 0.030). Concerning to the cognitive functions, response latency (P = 0.001) and error rate (P = 0.036) were lowered in the Stroop test, while executive function (P = 0.016) and verbal memory (P = 0.005) were significantly enhanced in the BACS test after L-theanine supplementation.This study demonstrates that chronic L-theanine supplementation (8 weeks) is quite safe and features with diverse beneficial effects on the improvement of depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and cognitive impairment functions in patients with MDD.This study was supported by an unrestricted research grant provided by the

I’m sure some do, but what I’m saying is that, if you don’t need meds to control your psychosis, then I’d more readily believe that you had a different disorder. Psychosis isn’t unique to schizophrenia, but generally, schizophrenic psychosis is much more severe than say psychosis from depression (based on what I’ve read about the subject; I’m not perfect). Schizophrenic psychosis destroys our brains, oftentimes permanently. In my opinion, trying to live with an illness as unpredictable as schizophrenia while unmedicated is very dangerous because you can slowly get very sick an be none the wiser."

176112949,"I use to have this persecutory one where people kept telling me they can ‘cut’ me… one day a friend of mine decided to explain what ‘cut’ is (talked to me like the TV, like the TV, it was his mouth telling me) basically he was like when your getting ‘cut’ you’ll feel a free like you as is freezing and it spreads… few weeks later I felt exactly what he told me happen to me while in traffic; I felt a cold freezing that started from my butt and started spreading all over my body… when it happened, I changed road lanes and took another route - freezing stopped after I drove away."

176112952,"Keep going. Also keep in my mind that just because you can’t do it in the stipulated time doesen’t mean you are not worthy. Many people use some extra time to finish their education for various reasons with or without mental problems. I finished my degree as a healthshop worker, but I had to use a extra semester to get there, but I did it in the end. Just do the best you can and hopefully you will get there. And even if you don’t there are always options."
176112953,"Punching stuff including myself is a symptom that thankfully went away with the paranoia and delusions. I remember when I was institutionalized early on, I would always have this off-center lump on the top of my right hand. Took me weeks to figure out that I was punching stuff, swelling my knuckles, and I had an old deep cut off-center on top of my hand that was stitched shut, and it was swelling like 5x as much as the rest of the tissue hence the lump. Do you just get angry at random, or is something the voices say making you angry? For me it was always being driven to anger at what the voices were saying to/about me."

176112961,"This i agree with. I put feelings away for ages and learned to distrust them. I think that brought me in bad situations and made me psychotic. Actually repressing emotions also made them come out in bad ways and inconvenient moments. Which made others feel unloved too. Ive been a bit of a hypocrite. Im in the process of beating myself up for past mistakes at the moment. It feels horrible, but facing my own stupidities and feelings of guilt/shame is perhaps also necessary to be a nicer person…if i dont get stuck in them. Wallowing in selfhatred does nothing to be kinder, i guess…it makes me self-absorbed."
176112962,My main problem is sort of visions too. They seem so real. Like I’ve had visions and voices of people dying. Now I don’t know if they died or not. And replaced by their clone. That’s how far my thinking goes.

176112982,"Wtf really, i did not know this, is this really true. Can someone confirm this."
174370750,I was better on Abilify because it stimulates dopamines unlike other antipsychotics. You’re suggesting a med increase which will cause more negative symptoms. My meds are working and meds only work for positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions. I suggest you read more about schizophrenia and meds.

There are people out there that can match up to your sex drive. I’m just saying… also I heard some antipsychotic can turn it down. At some point in the past psychiatrists believed schizophrenics couldn’t ever enjoy sex due to symptoms and ap’s but I guess times have changed.

Further more, the _NAME_ are (were?) a very professional organisation that would be unlikely to expose themselves to investigation over a (verbal?) insult. What did you call him? Reactions in the world are generally equal and opposite. If you called him a mf then he might punch you, but going to all of the trouble of having you wiped out would usually require (unless he is deranged) that you had done something to endanger him."

But with whole grains, beans, legumes, fruits and veggies it’s very good for you. I ate lots of healthy foods as a vegan so I felt really good."
176113085,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ I feel guilty and the psychologist is right I should not have walked away … but it got too much …i don’t see myself going back but I work towards not repeating the same thing again

176113093,Interesting! The intrigue continues !
176113094,Cant wait i hope its good like the old ones.
174370776,I was kidding for the most part. I have anger towards certain people and I get angry about having schizophrenia even this late in the game. But I still have many good moments.
176113095,"Mine started out as anxiety and panic disorder, then years later my moods began to cycle, then finally psychosis hit me. I still am an anxious person."
176113096,"I think i may could have prevented schizophrenia if I made the right choices. Well well, no point in regretting decisions I guess."
176113097,They may know everything but they are just voices in your head.
176113098,Telepathy is a fancy word for intuition.
176113099,Yes and a typical (first generation) antipsychotic could make negatives worse. Risperidone is a potent dopamine blocker and typical antipsychotics are even more potent.
176113100,Now they don’t rule.The politician is ruler right?
176113101,I can juggle four tennis balls.
176113102,"Therapy is not free here, last time I asked a psychologist it was 250$ for one session."
176113103,For how long have you had the voices for? With practice you could get better at drawing.
176113104,"I vomit every morning because i have a ridiculous level of anxiety and stress, my mood is really bad, every day i have panic attacks, I can’t sleep, i’m obsessed with a thing and i can’t stop thinking about it, so intrusive thoughts are free for destroying my mind, the suicidal ideation is back but at least i think positive symptons aren’t back, i have lost 3kg in 5 days, I feel very unstable right now I think i need a change of meds, now it’s obvious don’t help me much"

176113108,It’s very sad I hope everyone gets the help they need
176113109,You’re feeding into your own delusions and other people’s delusions. It’s like your obsessed with them. Not healthy.
176113110,good luck to you.
174370780,Good Show!..
176113111,"When the brain is stressed out due to some form of physical damage (stress or drug induced), it struggles to find an explanation for the stress in the environment. If the damage-induced stress is chronic, the brain makes an ongoing “crazy narrative” to explain the stress to your conscious mind, that persists until the stress is alleviated."
176113112,It made me dream and then it robbed me of those dreams.

176113115,Feeling depressed and hopeless about my life. I want to cry but theres no tears to be shed. I’m grateful for all I have and I have to keep reminding myself that I’m lucky things could be worse. But I am bored most of the time and i dont even think work can cure it i think it’s me and this depression that i have. I feel my brain shifting and constantly searching for stimulation and I cant get enough of it. When i was real psychotic and hearing things all the time i think that void was kind of filled now voices are down to almost not there and I dont know. Running use to give me a high and now it’s not the same still searching for it. I feel my brain is dying on me but at least voices arent bad it’s just paranoid thoughts. Ugh
174370779,"I feel that “one-itis” is a common affliction of schizophrenics. You harken back to a time when you were healthier and had more pull, when romantic interests were more possible, so when you unfortunately become schizophrenic, you cling to the idea of the last person who expressed that interest. I can’t tell you how to move on though, it’s pretty painful to lower your standards, and I don’t necessarily think you have to, if you can figure out how to attain rock-solid stability. Generally lowering standards is the path of least resistance though."
176113116,"At this point, I could do 1 of 3 things: Take another 0.5 mg of Klonipin and hope I don’t develop a dependency on that as well. Wait another hour and take my morning meds and hope those knock me out all day. (They usually do). Take my former pdocs advice and force myself to stay up all morning, afternoon and evening and go to bed around 8 or 9 pm to get back on schedule. He didn’t want me sleeping in the daytime at all."
174370783,Switching from invega to Abilify but will be just one when I’m done.
174370788,"I am sceptical of this also. I didn’t even really know what Schizophrenia was until I was diagnosed with it. Even then it took me two years to come to enough to have proper insight into my condition, and that made me suicidal and I ended up back in hospital. I don’t blame people for wanting to label themselves. There are a lot of people hurting who want answers. Naturally because it’s personal to them they must just assume the worst. My take on it anyway"

The worst moment after I quit working was when the lady cutting my hair asked where I worked, what I earned, where I lived, and what I drove. A preacher was sitting in another chair as I tried to explain that I was disabled and then I was schizophrenic. She then said she used to have a schizophrenic husband whom she left because he became too violent. The last time we talked there very little was said."
176113127,It’s a personal feeling of not belonging … I guess it may not be a sz issue …just not being able to feel like I fit in.
176113128,I just finished talking to my pdoc. I explained to him about this situation. I feel a lot better now.

I know im pretty severe but after last time i was suicidal i just knew i didnt want to kill myself. Like my whole outlook on life is changed. I look forward to the future and i know this is temporary hell. I feel like i dont have anyone to talk to about my delusions and hallucinations now
174370803,"Welcome to the forum! And, good advice"
174370793,"Hello, I am brand new here. I have been struggling with my mental health for over a decade. When I was younger, 13/14, I thought, truly believed I was, a human vampire mix. Like a vampire with a soul. I thought I had special abilities and I wanted to drink blood and kill/hurt others. A lot lead up to that, not talking about it only made the delusion get stronger and grow. I believed that for over a year, ended up far down the rabbit hole. I don’t like to talk about it and even here feel like I can’t say all the details. My mom found out after I told my best friend at the time. I only told her because I wanted to drink her blood. I was at this point where I lost reality completely. I told my mom it was made up and like a role playing game after she screamed at me for hours and asked if I really believed it and told me there’s no way I could believe such a thing. I never really got help. My only friend stopped talking to me. I eventually snapped out of it after a long time. I don’t remember h
ow but I was able to get back to reality—it took over a year and a half. I learned to keep my “crazy” to myself. I never knew not everyone heard voices. I’m now 26 and it’s getting unbearable. I’ve spent weeks locked in my bathroom; camped out with minimal food and sleeping in the tub to stay safe. I thought I was beyond all that; I haven’t had a break from reality like that in years; although the voices never went away. Now I am a mom to a toddler (my beautiful baby boy) and a wife. I work as a social worker and case manager. I have a whole life. The voices are getting worse. For a while it was only the few in my head, like my own voice (which everyone has) and the narrator and the other two. Now I’m hearing things outside of my head. I hope that makes sense. At the gas pump the other day I heard someone or something inside of it. It was making horrid noises and then I heard someone tell me to light a cigarette. (I didn’t, I know that would end badly). I had to stop and leave. I had an argu
ment with my husband about him going out for his birthday without me. I remember having a conversation with someone and they told me he went out with them. I was so upset. We argued and a lot about it. It almost ruined his birthday. I looked through my texts and phone records and I didn’t talk to anyone. No one came to visit. That conversation was with myself. As time goes on I know I’m going down into a bad place. Im confided a little bit in my husband and told him I saw one person once who wanted to diagnose me as having schizophrenia but I was young and pulled out of the therapy. I told him I thought I had “powers” when I was younger. I’ve been as open and honest as I can. I think we had a conversation about my mental state now. I feel like there’s pressure in my arms and that one voice I’ve fought to silence for years I hear him saying to release the pressure and it scares me. I’m irritable with our son. I have no patience. I don’t want to leave him but I find myself thinking about just 
going to sleep curled up with my baby. We could be saved from everything so easily. I think I told my husband this this morning but I don’t know if it was real. I’m afraid to go to the local emergency room, even though if I were one of my cases that’s what I would advise. I’m afraid they’ll take my son (another paranoid issue I know there are people trying to steal him. He’s just so perfect and I don’t deserve him) away from me. I’m afraid I’ll lose my career (I work with intellectual/developmental disability and mental health as well as addiction and substance abuse). I can’t bring myself somewhere because they’ll separate me from my family and Ill never get to see my baby again. They won’t let me have another baby. All of these things are in my head and it’s getting harder and harder to talk myself down and remind myself what is real and what isn’t. I’ve been using every technique I’ve learned or seen over the years and now nothing is working. I’ve been struggling for over 
a decade. I can’t get help; not in my position I’m in now. I don’t know what to do or where to go."

176113203,I am always upset with myself when I masturbate… I really can’t stand doing it… In the past I would take Vitex to help stop. Problem is it takes up to 3 months for it to take effect. I had to get off it because of a hospital stay… I just started again 2 months ago so I’m waiting. I also do not find sex appealing as well and consider myself Asexual.
176113204,Sounds like you would do well by trying to add the bread in afterwards. To see how it affects you seperately from the pms. Keep us updated if you want! I did take out gluten a week ago. I’ve read some stuff about how it causes the immune system to attack the lining of the gut and stuff. _PERSON_ how reliable that info is but just from feeling better without gluten I’ve decided to keep it out if I can.

176113207,"I’m actually not sure. Actually the second time was involuntary. I had registered at accident and emergency for overdose suicide attempt (a delusion in fact). Then I ran away from the queue back home. The ambulance arrived at our doorstep with the police. And I said that I was going to die to them, I want to be with my family. (delusion was that I will burn from inside out) The police probably thought I was talking about the overdose, so they said to me it is against the law to die lol. And as I did not want to go to prison, I went with them back to the hospital. So in fact it was voluntary but not content with it. At the time."
176113208,I’m so sorry. i hope you and your family heal from this.
176113209,"I just noticed that the old diagnostic manual, ICD 10 is replaced by ICD 11. There are some minor changes to the SZ diagnose, but it’s still as shallow.

176113218,I have another interview with the state today working as an emergency manager for the Department of Health in their emergency operations center. The job says it’s for three to six months or maybe longer due to the pandemic going on. I ran an emergency operations center in the Marine Corps after 9/11 so I have some experience. It pays really well but don’t know if I would give up my secure federal job for a temporary gig. I will see if they make me an offer. I could help fight the virus.

176113220,Balance has always been elusive to me. The title pretty much says it all. I guess it stems from some type of fear concerning hyperinflation which my family doesn’t possess. Worse it comes in the form of gifts to brother and sisters children so it creates secrets in the fam. I’m scared of it all coming to a head and blowing up now. My old man does that thing satirized once from The Onion where he’s scariest while trying to control his anger. There’s never an exception and worse I think he knows it’s visually more painstaking. Just haven’t said boo in awhile. Real shades of FML going on there’s other stuff too. Guess it’s the stess on everyone currently.

I wouldn’t call myself a Narcissist though"
176113223,"My pdoc was telling me that toddlers tend to be negative and that he thought I was and that I could just stop it. First of all, I was working hard then and didn’t consider myself that negative. Further more, I think a lot of us have the negative in our blood. That can change some but not the dramatic changes some people expect. For instance, I was visually negative and that is much less than it used to be due to my having a relatively helpful life.I still don’t smile much and know I’m a cold person, but I’m not done in this world until I’m dead."
176113224,I say anxiety/paranoia because for me the two go hand in hand

176113234,"Hmm. Gotta Admit It’s An Uncomfortable Topic. I Was Young Once As Well.

176113235,I have never had them say kill anyone but myself. My voices think they are Gods and want me to write their words and listen. That’s all really. Sometimes they get me to talking out loud but the meds keep it so where I can work 20 hours a week.

If I see my pdoc about upping the dose, he’s going to want a reason. When I did laundry last week, I hallucinated someone knocked on the door of the laundry room. It’s a small room, and the door was open, maybe three feet from me. I really don’t know if I should ask him for a dosage increase. Does anyone else have hallucinations like door knocking and bell ringing?"
176113244,_AT_MENTION_ I know you understood him correctly. I just think he doesn’t realize what he did.

176113256,"Great idea. Meet in other locations only!! Good! His words dont seem to match his deeds. But just see what he does when you propose to only meet in a coffee bar, restaurant, go for a walk, museum, go dancing, whatever you like. Have talks there about both your values and lives, joke, laugh. THAT is building up things and getting to know each other little by little. Running to your bed to have sex right upon entering the door is not. Tell him what he does now hurts you. Whether he empathizes (in deeds, not words) says a lot about him. Good luck…I know it is hard when you are in love and lonely."
174370833,"Hey, if you’re treatment resistant and you can tolerate the med, it’s a good med. It did a great job of dialing back my symptoms. It would have saved me a lot of grief if it had worked for me. I just figured I knew better than my docs and skipped blood tests. Total #FAIL on my part there. A lot of docs are quite happy to meet you halfway. If you’re willing to try a med and be compliant on it, they’re usually willing to work with you. They have so many patients who fight everything that someone who is recovery oriented will get support back. Wishing you luck."

Then something stupid happens like I become paranoid, or my delusions become prominent. Then I’m exhausted or scared and nothing but the absolute basics gets done. I didn’t sleep well last night. I had bad thoughts instead of dreams because I didn’t sleep much. Now because I didn’t sleep, I’m tired. An emergency therapist told me to stay away from the forums when I’m not feeling well as reading about others psychosis may amplify my own. I…guess…so?? When I’m not feeling well I tend to just post my own topics and read less but I didn’t realize That I was practicing avoidance until she said that.

174370841,"I got ill in 1980 at age 19. Spent almost the entire 80’s in hospitals and living in group homes and other mental health housing. I felt suicidal and felt like giving up hundreds of times. I was severely ill like anybody else. I suffered from psychosis, depression and delusions. But I kept going with the help and support of my family and therapists and psychiatrists. If I had given up I would not have experienced the following: I’ve been working almost steadily since 1983. I am close to getting my degree, just 5 more classes. For my own satisfaction. I’ve flown across the country a few times and a few other places in the U.S. I went water-skiing for the first time in my thirties. I’ve been camping a few times. I’ve been to a million restaurants and lots of movies. I was best man at my dads wedding. That meant standing up there in front of twenty people as my dad and my step-mom exchanged vows and holding my dads wedding ring and later giving the toast in the crowded hotel room where the r
eception was held. I’ve been to lots of parties, clubs, bars. Went jet-skiing for the first time in my thirties. Took long train rides to visit my dad. I got addicted to crack which is not a positive, good thing and it almost killed me, but I got to see the seamier side of life for a few years and later when I got clean in 1990 in AA, I sat through at least a 1000 meetings up until several years ago. I lived independently for 20 years, and six of those years I lived alone. I’ve dated a little, had a couple of short-term relationships with women who were way out of my league. I’ve had several cars, about 10 I guess. Had lots of money at one point but I’ve also been poor a lot. I’ve been at my janitor job for 5 years now, I get along with most people there. I have to admit though, it’s an easy job. Anyways, I’m not listing these things to brag I’m just showing what is possible even with this disease. And I’m showing why you should not give up. When I first got sick I was just like any other pe
rson suffering from schizophrenia. I saw no future. I saw no end to my suffering the first two or three years. I was just this rather naïve twenty year old who one day was living with his parents in an apartment partying with friends, working and driving around in my old 1966 _PERSON_ and had never even seen a therapist and then the next day my parents were driving me a 100 miles away to my first psyche ward. Then came hospitals and group homes. I was very ill throughout the 80’s but I improved in the nineties and eventually when I was in my mid-forties some of my symptoms started to noticeably subside. It was amazing. And as I got older, I started to get better in increments until now at age 58 I have tne peace of mind often that eluded me in my younger days with schizophrenia. My mind stops racing often and slows down. So I did all this because of certain things. First and foremost I take my meds religiously. I’ve been going to therapists and psychiatrists steadily. I co-operate in my own treatment and 
help myself. Quitting drugs was a huge step in my recovery. If you’re doing drugs or drinking I would recommend taking a hard look at your drug or alcohol use and try to objectively see how it is affecting you and your life. It may be causing more problems than you realize. But yeah, I’ve done a ton of fun stuff but I also had to do a lot of things that I hated. I didn’t always enjoy going to vocational programs or to day treatment or group therapy. I often hated it, but those are the things that eventually aided in my recovery. Don’t fight the people trying to help you. Being a rebel or a troublemaker is all well and good but it will also run you afoul and put you at odds with the very people trying to help you. The first years are the roughest for everybody But it gets better. Tell your psychiatrist your feelings about giving up. He will offer support and try to help you. It might seem like people in the world don’t care about you but there are some really nice people out there. I hope you got som
ething from all this. I hope you get the help you need and just don’t give up. Good luck."
176113317,My dr only gave me 10 mg of Buspar. It didn’t work at all so I just stopped taking it

176113319,"So it’s 12:43pm and I have completed my routine study for the day. I have practiced t’ai ji, written an analysis of one of the diseases of the heart from my book on the spiritual purification of the heart, and read a chapter of a book on physics. I opted for physics instead of continuing with the five “phase”/“element” theory of Chinese philosophy and medicine. The book on physics I have is short, only 79 pages, comprising of seven chapters, so I can easily read one a day. After that I think I will return to Chinese philosophy and medicine. I actually combined three diseases of the heart that I had already analysed in part, in my written analysis for today, and this exercise of daily contemplation is going well. I now have another nine hours or so in which to do as I please. Thank you."

Another one made me so spacy and forgetful that I didn’t know where I was (Risperidone). Latuda was pretty good to me, but not good enough. It also caused relentless akathesia. I switched to Vraylar, which is what I’m on now. Vraylar has been a life saver for me. I’m glad I switched. It helps the most for me, so far, with minimal side effects."

If you work at your own pace, you can at least achieve the required credentials to apply for law based roles. Anything more is completely dependent on how lucky your health reacts or treats you in regards to what happens to you between now and when you have the necessary second qualifications to practice the kind of law you would like to practice.

174370863,"Sorry Late to reply - Ive been hectic here. _AT_MENTION_ The first bit of advice i can give is do what _AT_MENTION_ suggested and write an email to PALS. In my 30 odd years of MH experience they will fob you off at the first opportunity. They have had funding cuts, staff are leaving - and frankly they dont want another mh case on their workload. I would suggest goto the CAB - and write a concise email explaining your concerns - and make sure you tell them what stress this has put you under. Under the NHS charter - PALS are obliged to reply to your complaint within 14 days. I had the same - i had to BEG the paramedic for anti-psychotic medication at an appointment with the local A+E. This was before i got the schizophrenia Diagnosis, they just thought i was EUPD (hence percieved pain in the arse) Like _AT_MENTION_ says - Its a postcode lottery - and im sorry, but your gonna have to fight for it It took involvement from the Police to get me to be taken seriously in the end - and give them a kick up t

At this point I question everybody I see walking around wondering were they sent by the _NAME_ to have a look at me, this dosent happen with people Iv known for years. The main places I go to are the local supermarket and town, they are easier to notice in the local supermarket and harder to notice in town where it’s busier. That goes for when I meet them in cars as well. Again easier to notice locally but not in town. Oddly I feel more at ease in busier places. Locally I’ll catch myself thought broadcasting. Il be insulting them in my thoughts and I’ll look for confirmation they can hear it by how they react to them. If they look angry or fidgety I’ll know they have heard the insults. It’s a recipe for disaster really because people will naturally fidget but for me 
this will be confirmation even if they can’t hear my thoughts ya know? How are you anyway?"

Getting a shot also means I don’t have to worry about running out of risperidone pills and also saves me a trip to the pharmacy every two or three weeks. I take other medications and having even just one less bottle to bother with is a plus.

I may not be moving forward in life but at least I’m maintaining what I have. My co-worker kept walking and I thought, “What’s wrong with a little venting?” These guys complain to me about their lives and problems why shouldn’t I do it back?

176113418,"Hey guys, this is my first post (well, technically the second because the first one got flagged). I don´t know what type of disorder I have (my doctor doesn´t talk about it). I had two major psychotic episodes in my life: Delusions, hallucinations both visually and auditory, disorganized speech, you name it. Probably both drug induced. I´ve been on zyprexa, aripiprazol, fluoxetine and some other antidepressant I don´t remember (and something for my sleep aswell). Nowadays i´m on aripiprazol 15mg. Everything happened like 5 or 6 years ago. I used to be a very productive and ambitious person, taking advantage of every moment I could on a daily basis. I think this has been a major change in my personality traits since then. Since my first psychotic episode I gained like 25kg and experimented a loss of sex drive. I need to point out that sex and having a good physique, taking proud of beeing “fit”, were two of my main objectives during my “more ambitious” phase. This is another example of 
one of my core beliefs beeing changed. I got really addicted to cigars after my first episode. I used to be a very social person, emotionally getting involved with people. Nowadays i´m extremely introverted and don´t feel emotional connection with anyone or anything. My symptoms nowadays are like: emotional numbness, lack of meaningfull experiences and apathy. The good news are that I got admitted to study my second degree abroads. I still don´t know how I will cope with the social and learning experiences this next year (for example one of my fears is beeing 10 years older than everyone else and not beeing able to fit in). Thank you guys for your comprehension. Best!"

My doctor told me the QT vulnerability is genetic, and they can detect it. But definitely ask more questions to your doc. I would imagine an american doctor on YouTube would be biased against drugs that aren’t available in the US. My Geodon requires ekg monitoring, too.

It’s not… nothing. And passions are infectious. But I guess I know what I don’t like… More examples are that I have no tattoos(not a knock on them though); I didn’t join a frat in college; and even picked a major in college whereby a girl I was having a “split second relationship with”… sold me on. The college major thing was still a zag where others “zigged”, but ultimately the memorable “lead” is that I copied someone. But finding a partner was definitely a goal, probably a priority over grades… the word “romantic” is applicable enough, and might be something that keeps me afloat. You were “There for me” once - months and months back. I remember you said something like “…and I have enough love…”, I’m not throwing that in your face while you’re (no doubt) i
n a different place and time(and mood); but I was wondering if you found someone now especially since you mentioned you got “stuck” somewhere. I said in my previous post I have a memory for words; I like coming full circle on stuff… and wish I could get more of that in my life!"

Question at the end. *** Saw my pdoc today and he is going to refer me for TMS and is hoping they take me for this, and if they won’t take me he is referring me for ECT. He said because I want to do things but I am held back and stuck especially Ithe early day so it’s like I get catatonic, and because I am trying hard but it has been years and no progress in this area of doing more. He explained why it’s like I get catatonic. But I can do things later day and evening, or when forced because my family needs me. *** So question::: I googled ‘catatonic’ and it is severe and yes it’s treated by ECT but people don’t move or speak when catatonic on Google searches. I just feel stuck, completely. Every morning until afternoon and then not quite as much in late afternoon evening but bad, but sometimes really bad. It is crippling - but - I can speak and use the washroom etc. I just sit half the day and feel like I can’t do anything. I cook dinner, take care of o
ur children and help with laundry as examples. But for example The other day I had an episode where I sat still for at least an hour and a half and felt stuck in a position on the couch. I posted about it. I felt so stuck… worse than no motivation. Then went and laid in bed. Stuck. But I could communicate well and type etc. Can catatonic look like that? I don’t have Sz I have bp1 etc. I looked online and theres nothing like that, no one functioning somewhat with being catatonic. Catatonic seems really bad. (But I trust my Pdoc 100%). I just want to know if someone has ever had or heard something like this please let me know. Maybe it’s the answer to what has happened to my brain and someone can help me understand."

174370876,I can’t remember exactly because my memory is a bit strange with times and how long ago etc n to does confuse me. I do remember that I had somewhat recently quit smoking. I did not believe I was schizophrenic because I believed my experiences were real.it took me over twenty years to say I’m schizophrenic. I was still a binge drinker back then and still got myself in trouble when I was drunk. I might have been studying aged care back then. I still had friends back then that I later lost .i might have had my daily chat friend then. I miss chatting and he was funny n nice etc

She thinks there is too much _USER_ID_ with schizophrenia and she rather I have autism instead which I might have aswell. Seven psychiatrists could not convince my mum I have schizophrenia. It took me over twenty years to believe I have schizophrenia. I believe I have it thanks to this forum and seeing others with similar symptoms. I am stable and well now. I have had people not believe me or hate on me for schizophrenia in the past but the biggest non believer was and is my mum. According to her the psychiatrists are wrong. I’m grateful she acknowledges that something was and is wrong with me because I felt it as a child and suffered.

174370898,"Maybe gluten was the problem. She stopped eating grains. I am not eating a ketogenic diet, i am raw vegan but i eat many avocados and olives. I will see if a high fat diet is going to help. I will put here a part of an article i read about the problems cereal consumption raises: "" Yet the agricultural revolution may have spelled trouble. Tellingly, whenever diets based on grain replaced the traditional diets of hunter-gatherers, lifespan and stature decreased—while infant mortality, infectious diseases, bone mineral disorders, and the frequency of dental caries increased. Some of these problems were never totally overcome. For example, despite a gradual increase in stature beginning 4,000 years ago, when diets became more varied again, on average we are still about 3 cm shorter than our pre-agriculture ancestors. The coevolution between humans and grain brought on genetic changes in both parties, but did not render grain a more suitable food for us than it originally was. One of the first hints 
that these circumstances could have implications for the psychological sciences was the observation that, in several countries, hospitalization rates for schizophrenia during World War II dropped in direct proportion to wheat shortages. In the United States, where over that same period the consumption of wheat rose rather than diminished, such rates increased instead . In South Pacific islands with a traditionally low consumption of wheat, schizophrenia rose dramatically (roughly, from 1 out of 30,000 to 1 out of 100) when Western grain products were introduced. There is now substantial evidence that, depending on genes carried by over one third of us and on seemingly irrelevant factors such as a previous viral infection, eating bread can adversely affect our body and brain. This article reviews the evidence for a wide readership in non-technical, plain English. The next three sections present the implications for the psychological sciences of the facts that bread (1) increases the permeability of the gut and 
likely of the blood-brain barrier in all of us, (2) sets off an immune reaction in those of us who are genetically predisposed, and (3) breaks down, during digestion, in fragments with opioid activity. The final section discusses whether a change in diet could possibly cure patients with mental illness."""

is cannot be replaced by chemical drug that performs the same tasks mentioned above In sz,never expect that the medication will do everything as it does in all classical diseases,but the medicine will do one thing in the person( making continuity in the biological life possible ),and all other things are left to the person’s own efforts that are supported by family,social and state care all lifetime Mysteriously, after the end of the first month of medical intervention,new immune things grow in the body nature that are sufficient to resist the schizophrenia existence without need for any medical intervention It seeks in every way to fragment the schizophrenia existence as it is fragmented 24 hours of the day to period of wakefulness and sleep Therefore,the sz existence are activate its functions only during the waking hours and it cannot fight sleep mechanism,so that the sz existence disappears completely during the period of sleep and the pathogen activity stop working !"

They used to do patient reviews on the wall of my doctors office and one of my psychiatrist’s patients said they were able to only see him once a year. (in a good way, effective meds and stuff, not a bad reason like because they could only afford to visit once a year.)

However, I am very glad to hear that it can be different psychotic disorder, as I really do not want to be schizophrenic.

174370933,"With me it’s very visual, I read this is rare in schizophrenia. I did go through a decade of eating lots of psychedelics so that might be the reason. I’ve seen faces, objects like trees morphing, game status bars, digital objects and persons etc. When I closed my eyes I sometimes went to another world I could control a bit. This world then spilled over into the real world once. A tiny amount of acid patterns from time to time. -Oh my psychedelic’s back on again- It all seemed very digital though, never real; I could also send images to other people, this is strange because I don’t have visual memory. I just had to think it and I could send it, like my brain was a controller for AR… Now I can use this to think visually albeit much less clear. What’s it like for you? What do you see?"

Sadly in Canada, FDA approved drugs take more than 5 years to become available. They take even more time to be covered by insurance according to my psychiatrist. Xanomeline will begin Phase 3 trials by end of this year so it will take more than 10 years before it becomes available in Canada and I will be over 40 by then But its always good to have hope that I will get my life back someday before I die of a heart attack because I have hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity and beginning to become diabetic, all at 29 y.o. because of antipsychotics. I gained 150Lb since I was on antipsychotics. I tried most antipsychotics, they only work for positive symptoms. I am on Latuda and I can only eat, watch Netflix and sleep. I can’t work, go to the gym, have friends, have a gf (She left me since I was diagnosed). I never go out of my p

176113639,"I would choose the top 3 options. Here is my optimal strategy and it involves the pt using a rating system 0-3 for the med each time they come in. 3 is maximum distress with a med, these side effects are intolerable and extreme and the med should be discontinued right away, and a different med should be tried. 2 is moderate distress. While side effects are currently tolerable, they are unpleasant and may not be tolerable long term. The strategy for this med is to give it 2 weeks and see if the side effect goes away or at least improves by this point. If not, then the med should be switched. 1 is no distress from side effects, but there are no therapeutic effects of the medicine either, or else it barely works. It doesn’t seem to do anything of real value. The strategy for this scenario (provided you are already at therapeutic dosage) is to wait 2 weeks and if no improvements are seen, increase the dose again. If another 2 weeks pass and still no improvement is seen, meds should be switched. (Ther
e is actually only tenuous evidence that raising doses past the therapeutic dose actually does anything to help more) 0 is the med causes no significant distress and is working as it should be. No changes necessary. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Note that it does take some meds quite some time, even months to reach full effectiveness. However you should start to see SOME improvement, even if it is just minimal, by around 2 or 3 weeks. Also in my experience if a side effect was not gone by 2 weeks it tended not to go away. I made the 2 week limit as often doctors have no limit and just say well hopefully it will work eventually, hopefully those side effects go away eventually, and people are stuck with months of wasted time and unnecessary suffering due to this. This sometimes comes with serious consequences for example if a side effect was weight gain."

176113658,It’s common people don’t think they are sick. I get tired quickly of people who say we’d be shaman’s or mystics or such. We have a brain disorder that affects roughly 1 % of the population. It’s a curious concern. I think it’s good there’s long acting injectables these days. People often don’t know they are sick and early intervention with appropriate medications really is a good thing. Certain places have bills of rights and things and you can deny your treatment. That is where the ethics lies. Still. I’m a fan of enforced treatment orders. Lets not turn this into an argument.

I have to go all out on it because i need more art pieces for my grad school application. All of my grad school application pieces so far have related to me processing mental illness, so heres my idea. Going to set up my room really messy with specifically chosen items that represent me in some way. Probably have to move some furniture around. Set up my tripod against one wall and take photos of me doing various symptoms of my mental illnesses. Like for paranoia looking out the blinds. For ocd walking back and forwth checking the door. For autism plugging my ears and rocking. All of these are my true symptoms so this will be a very honest portrait which makes me a bit nervous."

I hope that the stress lessens over time, but so far it has just increased. Tomorrow I am just going to take it slow. Hopefully my manager is there and I can talk to him about the schedule. If I get a definite no on adjusting the schedule I don’t know what I will do. I can’t handle a 38 hour week, two weeks in a row. Bit this kind of thing happens to me at every job.

176113700,That’s really frustrating. My voices used to get worse when I didn’t sleep. I think my Risperdal helps a lot with that now. Every now and then I have to totally eliminate caffeine to get my sleep back on track. As it is I still end up waking up at 3am or so because my cat wants to be fed and I sometimes can’t get back to sleep until I have a bowel movement. I also have to be a little careful about what I eat. Chocolate and fried foods seem to mess with my stomach and sleep.

I had also been on Eglonil (generic name for this med is “sulpiride”) and it was good for my schizophrenia symptoms but had elevated my prolactin levels. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do to lower prolactin levels while taking sulpiride. Abilify doesn’t help. Only thing you can do is quit sulpiride and take another antpsychotic… I don’t know the first med you have mentioned “chlorprotexen”. Can you write exactly what it says on the pill bottle ?

176113741,"I understand that schizophrenia already makes me susceptible to paranoia and big picture thinking. The mind is like a pattern making machine. We connect patterns to things we do not understand. Logic has helped me overcome some of the worst paranoid delusions I have had, thanks to a patient and understanding father who would help explain both the irrational and beliefs I had rationalized. I have learned terms like: fixed beliefs, magical thinking, etc. and how the consciousness is still not fully understood. So having schizophrenia does not have to verify there is no external presence of God, or that we carry on after our human bodies are gone. I just hope that we are given the chance to further explore the realms of consciousness and creativity. Sometimes the best way to overcome a delusion is not to confirm it. Like for instance with _NAME_ he could easily play on people’s collective fears or thoughts to channel the flow of information. Not saying what he said was right or wrong, but thats the 
issue. Society as a whole could have a collective delusion and we’d know no different. Facts are agreed upon evidence… If I could get rid of my schizophrenia I woudn’t though, because I dont know what it is or what caused it so why take it away before fully understanding those implications. To me schizophrenia is nothing like cancer of the mind. I hope they find a cure for cancer and Im sure they will one day find a cure for schizophrenia that will shed light onto what caused it. Its so difficult to have beliefs and experiences that dont match with mainstream tropes."

I asked what they were looking for. They had just come from a meeting where they found out a 1910 nickel was worth 3 million dollars. I was so excited. I was sure I had one. They had gotten some stuff for me at the store and had given me some change. I said I bet the nickel is in my pocket. I pulled out the change and started looking and the girls all ran over to look but it was not there. I then remembered my secret hiding place and went there to look for the nickel. Under a box I found a nickel wrapped in wax paper, dipped in rubber and stamped to look like a dime on one side. It was then that I remembered I was a Twentyone Pilot and I had used this nickel to make a poster for a concert. _NAME_, the lead singer showed up and said we needed to continue to hide the nickel or we would be in federal trouble for destro

I said to _NAME_ I’m going to sell this on _PERSON_ and a little piece of rubber broke off. The crowd that had gathered started to leave and no one was paying attention to me anymore and I accidentally dropped that little piece of rubber which I was going to glue back on. Then this beautiful young woman came over to help me search the ground for it. I couldn’t find it and got very upset."

176113760,"I think several environmental factors caused it in me. My parents were different towards me than towards my brothers too. I was sexually abused. I made some stupid choices (bad partner choice) that lead to revictimization, i got pregnant, i used medication which triggered psychosis. I had years of extreme fear before becoming psychotic. I think with my genes and a life like my brothers had/have, i wouldnt have gotten sz."
176113761,Borderlines can have temporary transient psychosis. Schizotypals can experience psychosis also.
176113762,Could be depersonalization. Or body dysmorphia. Or just plain delusional thinking. I remember when i was younger i would stare at my hands and myself in the mirror and just feel so confused that I was human. It didn’t feel right. It felt very strange. I never understood that feeling but it must have been part of my illness.

176113764,"Not really. But in 1985 I was working for this young couple who had their own business and became rich off it. It was a hot tub/ massage joint but it was perfectly legitimate. You pay your $6 or $7 dollars up front and then go in back to one of 9 private rooms and soak in a hot tub for an hour, maybe schedule a massage for afterwards. I worked their four years in my twenties. The couple were in their late thirties. The husband was not well liked by several of the other employees. He was kind of arrogant and abrasive and had a bad temper which he took out on the workers sometimes. I feel bad for him because he actually wasn’t a bad guy and he really tried to be nice. And honestly, me and another mentally ill person worked there all that time (they knew we were disabled) and he was rarely mean to either of us. The woman was young and cute and nice, always treated me nice, always smiled at me. Anyways they used to take some of the employees places. For instance, the bosses took me and the other disa
bled guy to a reggae concert way up in Berkeley. That was nice. Once they treated all the employees to dinner up in San _NAME_ in the North Beach area. And a picnic up in the mountains. We all had fun. But I’ll never forget the trip to the beach. Started off OK, we drove over the hills to the coast about 6 of us. Me, my co-worker, the husband and wife, a good friend of theirs and another employee. We parked and hiked down to the beach, set out a blanket, and took off our jackets, got some soda to drink. We sat and talked. Then, out of the blue, much to my surprise, my bosses and their friend took off all their clothes! It turns out it was a nude beach, lol. I mean I was a little surprised but I kept my cool and they started talking and then we decided to eat. We had like cold chicken or something and macaroni salad. We also had a big bowl of potato salad. I remember the friend at one point asked someone to pass the potato salad and he was crouched over it and (lol) my boss said, “Hey, get your dick out of 
the potato salad.” It was funny and we ate and played frisbee and talked and it was fun. I later told the story to my dad and he cracked up about the “dick in the potato salad.”"

My pdoc said the ap changes your liver function so your need twice as much alcohol to feel any buzz. It’s been very challenging but I’ve stopped drinking for a while now. Thru sheer will-power and discipline. I’m really happy for you that CBT and 12 step programs work for you, well done. I would like to also let you know that everyone is different and these methods don’t work for everyone. CBT is so invalidating it rapidly triggers my psychotics symptoms. 12 step groups and support groups are equally triggering for me. I steer well clear of them. I hope you have room in this thread for that info, it would be nice to feel included here…everyone is different & may have to find their own methods to stop using. You’d make an amazing nurse!

176113870,"When I was 18 a temp agency got me a job at Memorex. They were (or still may be) one of the original huge electronic firms in the late 1970’s-early1980’s. One of the first big firms in what later became known as “Silicon Valley”. I wasn’t sick yet but I was experiencing great anxiety and almost panicking at my jobs. Anyways, on the first few days, they had me washing microchips and loading them into plastic containers. By that time, I had about 15 different jobs and got fired from half of them but I had made a habit, starting at my first job as a dishwasher, of taking things from each job when they ended which was usually about three months. To me, souvenirs. The “souvenirs” could be as innocuous as a book of matches with the company’s name on them, or a plastic cup with the company’s name on it. At my dishwasher job, the night I quit, I took two chef’s knives. Stuck one in each sock, in each pants leg and walked out. I was kind of ashamed about the knives, those things are expe
nsive. But a shirt from a gas station, a hat from another gas station and so on. So at Memorex I took one of these 1980’s microchips. I took it early, a week before the job ended. I didn’t think it was a big deal until I asked another person there how much those cost. He told me $300 apiece!! I’m not usually a thief and I couldn’t believe what I had done. I thought they were worth $10.00 or so. But what was done, was done. And I got away with it."

176113892,Maybe you’re on a lower dose vs your older med.
174371008,I wasn’t suicidal while I was off meds for 2 years. But when I was on 200mg of seroquel I became suicidal and psychotic. That prompted me to go back onto abilify which I’ve been on ever since.
176113893,5th day back on Zyprexa and my dreams are really convincing and usually quite disturbing as they involve family hurting me. Is this common? Does it go away?

176113899,"You get a very strong sense of what you’re saying when you do LSD, at least the good kind. I did little of that stuff myself, but my older brother did, and he told me about it. Back during the first acid wave from 1968-72 everybody who took acid thought it gave them a profound insight, and they started to set themselves up as gurus and prophets. There is a song by the Grateful Dead called “Estimated Prophet” that is about that. Back in those days of San _NAME_ and _PERSON_ the scene was all about acid."
176113900,"I understood, I’m just stating fact, there will always be people that don’t like me for whatever reason. Nothing I can do about it and its nothing for me to get upset over I like you _AT_MENTION_ your a good person."
176113901,Hello friend! How are you doing today?
176113902,when i first got sz it was like waking up to a nightmare…it was like that for about 8 weeks…bloody awful experience…all i can say is that im grateful for having at long last found an anti psychotic that can help me…im now on 20 mg olanzapine and quetiapine 800mg…its a hefty dose but its better than being psychotic
176113903,"My relapses on meds were less severe than my pre-diagnosed, pre-medicated years"
176113904,Unfortunately disability isn’t an option at the moment but I am going to apply and see if that’s changed.
176113905,"oh, ok…is that like a fact, or is it backed up by research."
176113906,I feel soooo much better today. My meds are working wonders. Allergies are better. Pain is better. Mood is much better. I feel like such a dork for forgetting meds the night before last. I’ve been relaxing so far today but I’m getting ready to get started on some chicken chili I think. I guess I should do some dishes too. lol. What are you doing today?

176113912,I play video games almost everyday but sometimes I cant. I just feel like doing nothing. Caffeine helps a bit. I take caffeine pills and drink coffee.
174371010,Its good that you’re not depressed. I think severe depression is worse than severe negative symptoms. At least I am not suicidal from negative symptoms. Positive symptoms make me suicidal and homicidal though.
176113913,"Its all part of it- fate or whatever. Don’t be selfish but just busy yourself with being happy. There is someone who loves you, you are OK, Believe it!"
176113914,It knocks me out but I don’t feel any sedation. No side effects except dry mouth.
176113915,ive been on the 234mg since like 2013 i think. and still havent been able to return to work however i do enjoy doing volunteer work when i can. and i stay busy most days by exercising a few times a day in 30min to 1 hour sessions. i also have recently started reading books and trying to get into entertainment such as video games or movies to keep mood happy. i would like to point out that no two people are at the exact same spectrum level of severity. so really your question is irrelevant in the aspect that if you become healthy enough to return to work then you will be able to. however someone else may not be able to become stable enough to return since each person has there own threshold. but its good to communicate too to get feedback and insight.
176113916,Lucky you wish I could lose some weight steadily gaining weight and haven’t done anything different and no stresser’s except my appetite being through the roof that will cause me to gain weight but why all of a sudden without warning is my appetite crazy that’s a mystery.But anyhow still going to the gym hoping its not pointless going but if I sit home I will gain more weight not happy about it but what can I do its not like I can take diet pills they interact with my meds so I guess I am stuck any advice?
176113917,I take 2mg in the morning. 2mg at bedtime. I’ve been taking the extra dose in the afternoon.
176113918,"My counselor once said “Change is slow, if it happens at all.” And you have to ask if someone wants you to change did they ever really like you to begin with."
176113919,"Definitely NOT an excuse. I will say that some people suffer from intrusive thoughts about pedophilia, and that is not the same thing. A therapist can help with dealing with such thoughts. If you are referring to actual actions or desires, that is a totally different thing, and anyone dealing with actual desires has a responsibility to chemically castrate themselves so they stop having those desires."
176113920,The first one reminds me of a battle.
176113921,"Anything can happen though, you have to push yourself… there are days I don’t feel like doing anything too. Like yesterday I was on bed almost the entire day. I think maybe lowering the risperidone or changing to something else would help with motivation… Did you get to talk to you doc about med change?"
176113922,That’s good to hear that you think that. _AT_MENTION_ there are more negative comments on this forum than positive ones. I like being here and I know I’m getting support from people who care a bit.

176113930,"The biggest one , I think I laid to rest, it involves my sister and her husband starting a family 3000 miles away. Still I wonder sometimes if my folks are less patient or more stern with me because they’re really missing her."
176113931,I ended up homeless for a little bit sleeping rough during my last episode. I was so psychotic I didn’t know I was homeless I just thought I was escaping the apocalypse. It was a scary period for me. People kept trying to sell me drugs and thankfully I still had a savings account so I ate. There were other people that were obviously mentally ill and we didn’t really interact with each other.
176113932,Life even with injuries and traumatic past experiences was cake compared to living with sz. I think if “normal” people experienced the sedation of ap meds and went back they’d never complain about life ever again.

176113938,"_AT_MENTION_ I can honestly say I don’t know…I have a hard time fostering any blame or grief in her direction. Because until we had broken up I had never experienced that type of love or care. Nobody has ever watched out for me or pushed me so hard to get therapy, on medication, made sure I remembered to eat, etc. The codependency is part of what pushed her away, however. Which I understand. She has stated she has growing to do herself and that she hopes she can be better for me if we ever get back together. At this point I just want to become a better man so that I am worthy of her love if she comes home. If I can learn to love myself than other people may love me enough to not abandon me."

176113948,"IDK. Maybe I’m getting more confident being out alone late at night. I don’t really need to be out a lot late at night but sometimes I will run to the market for milk or I crave something from _NAME_-in-the-Box so I drive thru as late as 12:00 am or even later. I go out usually depending on dumb luck that no one will bother me. But I also tap into my experience and chutzpah. It’s only a damn supermarket and it’s fairly close and I know that just because it’s late at night people are still friendly. But tonight some punk with headphones was behind me in line. I glanced at him and I thought he was on drugs. He looked clean cut and was dressed like an average person and I realized I didn’t know if he was on drugs or not but I got the slight feeling he was mocking me because I had trouble with my debit card. I payed for my milk and went to leave but the door was locked to the outside so I had to walk back past him to the other door. Yeah, he looked like a smartass so I looked at him until h
e lost his cool and then I laughed. It was very satisfying and hey, he’s a big boy and can take care of himself. My confidence comes and goes."

176113951,"I’m kind of in a similar boat. I was in a car accident, and under my work insurance contract if I work 20 hours a week, I lose all of my benefits. It’s absolutely ridiculous, and I have no idea why it is designed that way. You would think if I worked, they could deduct it from my benefits and save money. I also have no drug coverage, so basically I would have to give up my work benefits and go on welfare to receive drug coverage. It’s a weird system to navigate, for sure"

176113971,I have options and I do have a good job for my hometown. I get a raise next April too. And I will get another retirement check out of the deal. I love my house where I live and I can afford all of the bills even before I started working again. The New York job had two more interviews today and if I end up being near the top of the list they want me to fly out for an in person interview. I should know something tomorrow or Monday. I may just do it if they invite me. I have never been to Manhattan.

176113975,"Definitely an overlooked symptom of schizophrenia/SZA. Avolition and Anhedonia are the main negative symptoms that I suffer with but more and more I’m experiencing social withdrawal, another common negative symptom. I just want to avoid any kind of social interaction with most people. I don’t have the desire for friendships and intimacy.

176113978,I moved a lot when I was young too. Mainly because my father was a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam war. As a young woman I moved fairly often too. I got more settled as I got older. I’ve been living in the same city now since 1996.
176113979,No hallucinations.
174371034,"Abilify gave me TD and they immediately took me off of it. I took a little while to go away. When I take 4 mg of Rexulti it flares up so I can only take 3 mgs but I don’t do to well without it and I can’t seem to find another ad that works quite as well on my suicidality so I take the risk. My fingers twitch daily, but not constantly. My mouth no longer moves. For awhile I thought I was gonna be stuck like that. It’s mild, it’s not the end of the world like everyone seems to think it is. Maybe you could reduce your abilify and that would stop the tongue involvement but still give you the benefit."

I’m one year self-harm free, but I’ve certainly been tempted when I get upset. It can be really rough to resist, but coming here has helped a lot. Y’all help me reason things out and calm down. Regarding the pills, I took them to keep me sleeping. I just wanted all of my problems to go away, and it seemed like an easy solution. Coming off them was hard, but I’m about to be fighting another battle with that. I’m on Saphris, and it make me sleep- which makes me happy. I am switching to Risperidone, but that doesn’t make me tired. I’m scared of coming off the Saphris and having to face life, but I’m equally tired of not living it. I’m really scared. I want to be done with it, though."

176113994,"Two of my recent therapists practiced some DBT techniques with me and I found them very helpful. The center I go to also runs group sessions but my insurance wouldn’t cover them so I would be stuck with a $40 copay for each meeting. It’s cool though that I have found PDF copies of DBT books on eBay such as this : eBay DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets, Second | eBay Find many great new & used options and get the best deals for DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets, Second at the best online prices at eBay! Free shipping for many products! I really like having the pdf’s on my phone because I can open it on my phone whenever I want to. I also learn a lot by watching YouTube videos on it. I am not sure if there are apps that might be useful too, like for chain analysis. Has anyone else tried DBT?"
176113995,For me - its taken about 6-7 years after initial diagnosis to get on the right meds. Its a very slow learning process. With you working with your Psych Team - to find out which drug works PERSONALLY for you. You gotta accept that your gonna have some form of symptoms for the rest of your life. Its not all about the drugs. Its about you learning the proper coping skills to learn how to deal with them - and you accepting that.THEN you will be happier x

174371046,"When I was a child, my family was considered the worst apprehension case in the history of where I was. We didn’t eat for days, which caused me seizures. Before I developed schizophrenia I felt such anxiety never knowing where to take my next step. Now, I can move on with my life and feel peace. Peace because of schizophrenia. That’s the truth, I like having schizophrenia. Whenever I feel down I have friends to talk to, even though I don’t have a mother or father."
176114007,i tell my pdoc mostly everything these days… i used to be careful what i said before but since last psych ward stay i share most things cause i realized they need to know everything to be able to help me.
176114008,"I don’t know. I don’t feel like I get a good effect from hard liquors, so I’m thinking it might be something about beer specifically. But if I get no effect from yeast then idk."
176114009,I wonder what other remedies help for blepharospasm… _AT_MENTION_ What do you think? Have you ever dealt with this?
176114011,Be careful with niacin. Large doses are very hard on the heart.

176114019,"I get these porn popups sometimes of young Russian girls. Its disgusting and I don’t find them attractive as they look so young. Not sure how young they are, russians and asians look too young for their age."
176114020,You’d be surprised how much research there is. It comes as a big cost to society + they can make a lot of money of meds because 1 percent of the population will need them on daily. But for a complete cure there is less incentive. But I think it’s only going to come with some revolutionary advances in Biology in general…
176114021,"yes its ????, but I had a baby and a five year Old daughter that been with me for like tow years and I miss than so much, no one could really see tham and I never want to be normal for the small chance that they will came back."

176114023,"YES! I wrote two crime novels, good reviews, before my sz disorder made it impossible to write coherent. I’m very bad at verbal communication, so whenever i meet my psychiatrist i write a page long note about my status."
174371037,_PERSON_ most mentally ill are not violent but still more than normal ppl. “Most individuals with psychiatric disorders are not violent. Although a subset of people with psychiatric disorders commit assaults and violent crimes” Mood disorder patients are more violent: “About 11% of people in prison for homicide have schizophrenia and 21% have mood disorders.”

176114025,"If we assume,for sake of argument,that are 2 people who speak the Chines language (for example) ,one of them ill with corona and the second with Sz,and both of them are in a state of deep sleep. And there is a doctor who does not speak this language The Questions; 1- Can a doctor diagnose a case of corona in a sleeping person ? YES 2- Can a doctor diagnose sz( or the hallucinations) in a sleeping person ? NOT possible,because there is no material for the sz or hallucination to reveal it the matter requires the person to be in a state of alert,mutual bilateral dialogue with the doctor in the presence of a translator"
176114026,Probably not. Do some simple exercise but talk to regular doctor first. I know your in a pickle but do what you can to keep active. It really does help in the long run just as it does taking the pills.

176114032,Since a couple years i feel ok most of the time. I get anxious sometimes still but not like when I was in psych ward last time. I couldn’t go outside then. I was in my room for a couple years where i just got out to eat and besides that i was always in my room cause that was the only place i felt at ease.
174371052,What does the word “bolstering” mean in this context? (non native speaker here) I know my schizophrenia or psychosis or whatever is fed largely by the guilt I have over things I did wrong. Sometimes things that are genuinely wrong. Sometimes bizar things that nobody would care about.
176114033,"Find a very large plastic container and a piece of cardboard similar size of the plastic container. Spend 10 min summoning up the courage to capture the bloody thing. Once captured, take outside quite a distance from the house, and then setting free by throwing both container and cardboard, for collecting later when sure it has moved on. I do this with our local huntsmans."

176114037,"Hey everyone, It’s been a while since I last posted. I was so hopeful about this higher dose of seroquel, because I was experiencing so many benefits the first couple of weeks on it. But the past few days, I’ve been feeling really off. I started having trouble focusing again, then started having minor hallucinations (seeing lights in my head, etc) that would come and go. Today I’ve been feeling kind of paranoid and doubting things that I know I shouldn’t. It’s not bad enough to go to the hospital, and I see my pdoc on Friday so I’d like to wait until then and see if he thinks I should increase the dose of the seroquel. I’m still complying with taking the medicine, and if it gets to the point that I can’t manage the symptoms, I will go to the hospital. But I don’t want to do that every time I have symptoms return, so for now I will try to just wait it out till Friday. _NAME_"

174371057,"Oh I get there feels too. I call it a version of ‘clairsentience’ it’s a thing sorta like empath. Particularly sensitive to energy vampires. I feel like I feel people’s physical pain sometimes. And emotional and mental. My ankles once swelled up for no reason like I had diabetes but I don’t. Was bizarre. Three times their previous size, couldn’t put shoes on. Clairsentience is a thing."
176114056,"Is it the feeling itself, and it stops there? Or does it go any further? It sounds like it could be paranoia that you have."
176114057,"Benefits of masturbating: safe way to release endorphins and oxytocin. If you have a penis, it keeps you from having wet dreams and needing to wash your sheets unexpectedly. It can make you feel less frustrated throughout the day. It can help you get to sleep, and relieve insomnia. Experimenting with yourself on your own makes you more knowledgeable about what you do and do not like, so if you ever decide to have partnered sex, you can communicate your wants more easily. Cons: It can occasionally become addictive, though when this happens there is usually an underlying reason behind it. If you use video porn, someone might be being exploited in the production of the video. A lot of video stuff can warp your view on women. Really, as long as you stay away from exploitative stuff (research your companies and only buy from places that treat their employees well; give up on free porn) you aren’t hurting anyone. It is a personal choice for everyone whether or not they masturbate, and the decision has 
no moral value."

174371058,"We have a huge folder of all of the emails. What’s hilarious is the person keeps intentionally spelling her own name wrong to try to make us think its not her. However she spells it wrong in the same way every time, therefore it’s obvious these emails are coming from the same person. Plus its the same complaint over and over and over. Like really? We know it’s you! Just stop already _PERSON_"
176114059,Sorting it out.
176114060,"Okay, okay, Hi Sister."
176114061,Also I find vaping nicotine helps me in focusing and relaxes me. Not encouraging you guys to smoke but vaping is 95% safer than cigarettes according to studies. Small vapes are healthier than big vapes.
176114062,I guess I must just suffer alone. All my pdoc replied with when I wrote to him yesterday and today was was disappointed he didn’t give advice he just thumbs upped my update. But what advice is there to give? Nothing. Just to suffer it out. Mental illness is a very lonely thing.

174371059,Risperdal is decreasing dopamine levels too much and that is the reason for very severe negative symptoms you are experiencing.
176114072,Yehh I remember 20mg is like a max dose so 7.5mg sounds good. Great sounds like some of ur symptoms have improved already that’s exciting. Thank you for the well wishes

176114090,I would say “My mother thinks I’m still a baby and need to be watched.” so that was the solution.
176114091,My room is small and cosy. I realised that life can be better if I talk to my parents more. I did that today and it felt good. Spoke about my anxiety at my interview and how they were specific about my health condition. It felt good to open up a bit with them. My head feels less tense now. So it’s getting more bearable living at home
176114092,The last time I went to the hospital they told me I could either go voluntarily for 10 days or they would have a judge commit me for 30 days. The law doesn’t move too fast because I spent 12 hours in the ER that day. I wouldn’t sign the paper. Of course I was psychotic as hell and only thought I was there like 15 minutes and needed the stay. But they never found a judge that day. I finally got carted off in an ambulance.
176114093,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ !!!
176114094,Yeah I think it’s the most realistic way to do it and the slower you lose it the more it stays off.
176114095,Like a feeling of light head with like static running through there body to your head. Am I hallucinating or is it a side effect from the meds? I usually get this feeling when I’m withdrawing from something but lately I’ve been getting it everyday

I’d rather just be prescribed new medications and try them in the comfort of my home, then wait and see if they work. Being in the hospital has no benefits for me and I hate being there, there is nothing to do other than play cards or share a TV between like 20-30 people which means you rarely get to watch what you want. The beds and pillows are uncomfortable. I spent a month in the psych ward about 2 years ago and I couldn’t wait to get out, didn’t find it helpful at all."

No way should you feel you need to out of guilt. Only do what you’re comfortable with My main message is that there are so many ways to work that are quite flexible, and doing different things. What one person finds hard, someone else may find easy. All you need to do is find something you enjoy. If that’s volunteering for a day a week at a charity store, that’s a start. One day you might feel more comfortable, and go for a paid job. It’s entirely up to you The main point I was trying to get across is that it’s not as much of a lost cause as the health professionals make out. They were trying to rob me of a life, and somehow I managed to separate myself from Mental Health professionals for two years, and when I got back in contact I was working full time, and they had to deal with it. No way am I saying it’s easy, but being a

176114121,Its a crap shoot but it takes time to find the balance. I started on risperdal. Wasn’t good for me in the long run but brought me out of psychosis. I know your not seeing that psychosis yet but there’s reasons why they treat you like you are so hang in there.

As for friends, i never really made any until i started working. And even then i’ve only told a very select few people. Thankfully, they also accept me for how i am. I agree wholeheartedly with _AT_MENTION_ - those who don’t need help get so much support and assistance in life. When you’re down and hard on luck, no one has time for you, and the places that are supposed to help you, don’t.

Now l take light breakfast, dinner and larger lunches. Water definitely helps also. Chug down as much water as you like and you wont feel too hungry. Cold water now is SORTA like a coke for me.

176114190,"I have done a lot of temping which has suited me fine because I like job variation. I agree that it might be the right move to quit if you don’t feel like it’s a good place to work. I have been working the same place on and off for the last 9 years because my colleagues are nice, I get to physically move around a lot, there is variaton and I get to deal with customers which I find interesting. You have had a few jobs before this one so you have something to compare with. Which job did you like best and why? What is important to you in a job? If in your current job the cons outweigh the pros, then maybe you should quit, but if there are positives you might consider staying on. It could be a good career move to stay in a job for a while or else the next employers might look at your resume and wonder why you never held down a job for more than a few years. If you like variation I would consider temping, then you might get different assignments at different workplaces every few months, and you have 
a “alibi” for switching jobs. Although this whole point isn’t all that important, but something to think about in the big picture."

176114193,I just feel if I moved away it would have been a good precaution. Like just in case something bad happens to me. I can’t see any reasons why anything would go wrong if I did this. My only reasons I’m not moving away is laziness and weight gain from meds. Also it isn’t easy since someone is always home. Also I can’t do things secretly because someone always intercepts my mail if I was to get a passport and I would have to sneak out to order one and I just don’t feel like doing these things. I feel like I’m going to hell for my laziness.

It will never end or get better. In fact it has the potential to get worse. In fact, it is very likely it will get worse. I’m going through something similar and I’m filling out applications for other places. I’ve never met more sadistic people in my whole life. I get angry at them all the time. Sometimes they know it, sometimes they don’t. TBH, I’ve been through my share of conflicts and hard times but these people frankly quite scare me because of their sadistic cruelty.

176114213,"_AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Okay, that was my shortest unplug ever! Not because I had a uncontrollable urge to return but because I realized something --> I dont want a reality without fears existing. I wanted to unplug because my brain was telling me: “If you do this, then you know you can find peace with monotony, boredom and loneliness.” So the desire for this knowledge was pushing me to try acheiving this knowhow. But as I sat there, my mind said something “I dont want a boring, monotonous or lonely future. IF such an imagined future becomes a reality in the physical world, I will try and cross that bridge when I come to it. Simulating a version where I know that I can replug at will is not the same as a reality where replugging does not seem possible.” I need this forum! It, and the folks like you on this forum, are what keep me going on when I’m hitting my lows. Over the last few days, I’ve been pretty pensive over my reality. My thoughts lie around the range of “Nothing matters i
n the real world” while my awareness has been of experiencing states that did matter to me even on days I was thinking like that. More and more, I am discovering that I am not just my thoughts. I am also an awareness of my thoughts. And ultimately, it is how that awareness perceives each state of experience that colors my view of the world I am in. This could be free fluff thinking on my part…but it has meaning for me. I am getting an inkling of a video montage to create. If I do, I’ll post it in Creativity.

176114244,I dont know what this is. Cause it’s not just sadness. It’s like my soul hurts and aches. Not my heart but my soul. I dont know how else to describe. I know what triggered it.

And I found out that a coworker that I already very much dislike was openly excited that he died. I’m mad at this coworker but not as mad as you would think. Like I said my soul just aches. It aches for her because she’s living her life finding excitement in death. And other things that I dont feel like getting into. I feel bad for her. And today I just hurt and feel sad.

I wanted to know if anyone else experiences this feeling of being drained after concentrating on something too much. I’m writing a memoir and thinking about when I first got sick. There is a slight pressure in my forehead when I start to feel drained. If I don’t find ways of relaxing myself, things start getting harder like trying to take a shower, etc. I walk around as if in a fog. I am half present it seems. What is this experience called?

176114297,"When it happened to me, I was 19 years old. I know that my grandfather on my mother’s side was once hospitalized and it was suggested he was schizophrenic, so when I finally got the right diagnosis it made a lot of sense. Up to that point, I thought that every episode was aftereffects of the night I was drugged. My psychosis began with just one delusion from 2006 to around 2010: I was either still lying mangled and dying in the car accident in 2006 or already had died and vividly remembered the accident. I actually FELT the physical sensations of being killed. I basically ostracized myself from all of my friends/family in the first couple of years with _PERSON_. I was always an introvert with social anxiety, but when psychosis hit I became practically reclusive. I had to stop smoking pot altogether because it was like a psychotic bomb went off every time I got high. Random unconnected delusions began making an appearance in 2009-2010, but the car accident never fully went away. Sometimes I was co
nvinced that my sister didn’t exist (I made her up or she was a split personality of mine), sometimes I felt/feel like there are cameras everywhere and everyone is in on something but me (_NAME_ Show Complex), I’ve questioned whether my husband exists, I think I might still be in a hospital and imagining ALL of this in a catatonic state, a few others. I’ve gone through random periods of time over the years where I’m hallucinating and living in my delusions at 100%, then periods where it’s down to 20% and I can mostly function like a normal person who doesn’t overthink everything. For the first few years, I tried nearly every single AP, nothing actually worked for me without having debilitating side effects. I was raised in a Christian family, so for a decade or so I felt HORRIBLE guilt about a handful of things and thought I’d gone to “hell”. But for years now, I’ve been studying traditional wiccan paths and alchemy, and it’s really helped. Not only did that connection help my depression 
(a little), but now I have a handful of POSITIVE delusions lol. I’m less and less convinced that I’m _PERSON_ and thinking now that I have always had this ethereal connection and just didn’t understand it. For the past couple of months, I feel like I’ve been remembering what I was before I was born Heather in this life. I feel like I remember how unique and powerful I actually am, and know what it feels like to be other than human."

And, I am sorry to say, but you have a long history of interpreting social situations in the opposite way that most people would, which has led you to some very troubling misunderstandings. You interpret interactions between yourself and young women as them flirting with you a LOT. You interpret interactions between yourself and young men as them being aggressive towards you a LOT. Either you live in the most overtly sexual and aggressive place in the world, or you are interpreting things incorrectly. I think you have an unconscious bias that skews your ability to read social cues appropriately This is your place of employment.

176114318,"Hi, I like to share the mechanism by which how these able to control some individuals. Here is a test to see if you are prone to these. Imagine current year is 2000. Keep repeating in mind as if its real. If you start to feel like 2000 then your prone to these. How quickly you believe determines the extend. If very quickly then delusion chance high. If less quickly with doubt then intrusive thought chance and so on. This is why some individuals believe in their doubts, story, plots, ideas etc so deeply as they quickly believe in it. Dopamine has a part as it helps individuals to focus, thrive on their ideas and goals. So if anyone want to prevent such negative aspects then think logically to see if its practical or not, compare with lives of other people etc and once it found false then manually not focus on such, instantly dismiss it even though the urge and feelings there.

176114319,"I should have clarified that, it’s not necessarily insecurity, it’s people who have high self esteem that have found themselves in an environment that doesn’t promote that. For example someone who thinks highly of themselves but is stuck in a lowly trivial job where they are not respected would be someone who would be especially prone to a grandiose delusion. Their feelings of superiority come under attack by being in an unappreciated position in life, this lets them ignore those signs that maybe they are not so special after all. Instead of saying “oh I’m just a simple janitor” they can say “oh I’m god” and then their view of themselves is preserved. Does any of that make sense. It’s not necessarily due to insecurity it’s when self esteem is attacked."

176114322,"I was unusually devoted to God as a child. I had no religion, my family never once went to church, I knew not one verse of scripture of any religion. But I always thought of God. I saw Him as a child my age and we were best friends. I sometimes heard him speak, but these ideas of Him were unconscious. I was also a very imaginative child. I was healthy in mind and body, I always made friends easily. I got ill in 1987. In 1992 I had a relapse of my illness for an unknown reason( I had been in remission, with the aid of medicine ). My voices got extremely loud and one in particular. He later became my God, and I think he is the same God I had as a child, my Imagination quite literally. After 28 years of abuse I now know he is not God. But, he can seem devine, like a Christ Self. Other times I could swear he is Satan himself. He is quite confident he can utterly mortify me, so that I not only have no self worth but am a complete and utter mockery. I don’t know how to win, he is a power greater than I

If you are using it to put yourself down, as _AT_MENTION_ is doing, you would be better off just not saying what you were going to say, because putting yourself down will only make your self esteem worse."

I started texting myself every night before I went to bed for that job. For my current job I carry a bottle of each of my morning meds and anxiety medication in my back pack which I bring with me every day. I used to keep them in my car but these days I never know what car I am driving. If I take my dogs to day camp I drive my wife’s SUV. If not I take my car.

I have slight PTSD and my sleep is disturbed. Considering I almost died last time I was unstable, and walking in the middle of the night and not showing for day’s I’m happy where I am right now.

176114425,_AT_MENTION_ were you closer to 1200 or closer to 1400? I found that the closer to 1200 i was the slower I lost. My body just likes the little higher better for some reason. My sister said “it takes calories to burn calories” jokingly. But I thought about and I think it’s kinda smart.
176114426,The call I took today wasn’t really an interview but just a talk. The hiring manager flew the same kind of helicopter and airplanes that I flew but in the Navy not the Marine Corps. He had some other people to talk to. Real interested in something called SMS. Told me to look it up on the internet. It’s a safety program. Said he would be in touch about an interview. They want someone there this month right away. He didn’t disclose what the salary was or if there was relocation. Will have to stay tuned.

I was driving my high school girlfriend home one night during a blizzard and saw this girl with hair down to her waist wearing shorts and a t shirt in the middle of a blizzard walking on the side of the road. she was dazed or drugged looking.

I just ended up in strangeville but luckily got off work and moved home to my parents…It took some time to get the meds right for me in recovery. That was painful but worth the effort and time.

Yes body get used to it and thus create a chemical, hormonal and other imbalances too but the point to note is the individual created it in the first place and the urges is due to the after effects, the more indulge in it more the urge and the cycle goes on. Withdrawal effects is natural whether its alcohol, drug or other even watching youtube daily creates addiction. But the thing is if its harmful to have such addiction then we need to stop it and prepare to meet the withdrawal stage and after that freedom comes and no longer need to do it."

I do believe I have lost my mind. it is impossible for others to hear your thoughts correct? is there a machine or anything that can do this? I am so lost, I know my use contributes to my situation, but there really is something wrong, and I don’t know where to start going for help. I am going to make an appointment with a general doctor, but as I said before any advice is appreciated. Also, my mind thinks things that I really do not believe and I cant seem to stop it or from these thoughts entering my consciousness, I don’t really know how to explain this… These negative thoughts just seem to come from no where and I cant stop them. Its nothin
g crazy, just like name calling type stuff, but I truly don’t agree with or believe them and I cant seem to stop this from happening, its driving me mad. Please give advice, ive had as much as I can handle in this regard and am truly looking for a way for it to stop. I hear voices making fun of me, or people responding to my thoughts, and I even hear myself ripping in to me sometimes. Stopping any of these problems would help me immensely. I realize logically that this makes no sense, I mean how could people know what thoughts entered my head from a house next door. I realize body language and lip reading, but they seem to hear things that I don’t mouth or say… I don’t understand whats going on or what to do about it, how do I stop it?

174371172,"I’m 58 years old, I was diagnosed when I was 19. I went the whole suffering route for a couple years and spent most of the '80’s in hospitals and group homes, and incidentally had a crack addiction in the late 80’s that I eventually took care of. But I’ve had some good years and too many great experiences to count. Once the initial two years of solid psychosis eased up I started to slowly integrate into so-called “normal society”. I got a job when I was 22, I made a couple of friends. I remember living in supported housing when I was 22 and living with other mentally ill people in an apartment building and making friends with my neighbor. I remember what a big deal I felt it was when my neighbor and my roommate took us out to eat at a food court near us. I remember feeling almost like a kid sneaking in and actually being in public and actually sitting in the midst of normal people in public. I felt we were getting away with something just eating in public. It seems such a weird feeling 
to look back on that attitude because since then, not only have I eaten matter-of-factly at a hundred restaurant’s since then and felt perfectly at ease, but now in the span of my lifetime I’ve been to such varied things as concerts (Aerosmith, _PERSON_. _NAME_ etc.) I’ve been to comedy clubs and plays and movies and felt perfectly at ease and felt like I belonged there like anyone else. In my forties I used to take a two hour train ride to visit my dad and I also drove myself there which was about a two hour drive. I’ve flown across the country a couple of times for vacation with my dad and step-mom to stay at my step-sisters house who was my age. The highlight of the trip was when my step-sister got drunk one night and I woke up on the couch in the living room one night to find she was laying full length on top of me, lol. Us schizophrenics get damn lucky sometimes, just like regular folk, lol! (nothing happened though). But I’ve had many experiences both great and bad. I’ve hung around my siste
rs and all their friends and their husbands. I’m looking back on being almost steadily employed since i was 22. My drug addiction almost killed me but I got to see a little bit of the underbelly of society and little of the darker side and it was very interesting. I got clean but my addiction was one of the sore points in my relationship with my dad. I caused him some trouble and he was so pissed off at me until the end of his life that just mentioning AA, CA or NA would anger him or anything else that reminded him of my drug use. The only semi-positive comment I got from him about my drug days was when he begrudgededly said that I lived in the fast lane for four years. Which was true. Anyways, I’ve lived on my own in the past, I’ve been taking care of myself since 1995. I’ve managed my own finances, took care of my car, made all my appointments myself and went to them on my own. In some ways I’ve lived a very normal life through the specter of having this major mental illness has haunted me and liv
es in me all the time. I’ve just done many fun things though I’ve really slowed down. Unloading trucks at Sears for four years in my thirties took it’s toll and now I have a bad back. But I was about the best worker on the crew. I think you get the general picture in my answer to your question. I’m not a fluke, keep coming to this site and you will see other schizophrenics who have done amazing things. I’m luckier in life than some schizophrenics and not as lucky as others."

176114589,"sharing my experience, i have no one else to share this with that i feel comfortable with: I had two entities (as i call them) that were bad, the first one was some kind of unseen form that would follow me around my school, it used to live in my classroom. it knew everything bad about me, what i had done and what i was going to do, if i ever left anything i had touched in the classroom, even trash or a pencil, it would touch it and know everything bad i did and would reveal it to everyone i loved, so i refused to leave anything in the classroom and took all my trash home with me. I thought if i did that id be safe until one day it followed me home and began living in my basement. it would send presences to follow me when it could not leave the basement. I took all my belonging out of the basement and into my bedroom, before long i became a hoarder. another one came to me later in life when i was about 17 or 18, an entity with sharp teeth and i could hear the teeth gnashing and clicking against each 
other when it whispered to me and crouched outside my window. during the night it sent intruders after me that tapped my windows and scratched at the door, knocked on my windows, they wanted to get me. i didn’t leave my house for years."

176114661,Thank you _AT_MENTION_ Good to see you back at this.
176114662,Idk what’s wrong with me man. I’ve had zero interest in food for days. I mean I make sure to eat at least a few hundred calories everyday. But yesterday was a new kind of awful. My body finally felt hunger. But it didn’t translate in my head. For the life of me I could not pick a single meal that sounded interesting enough. I didn’t care enough to make even an easy dish like oven pizza. I spent over an hour looking at menus but I didn’t care enough to put an order through. It doesn’t make sense. I ended up eating a handful of almonds and a boiled egg just so I’d stop feeling faint. And today I feel the same.
176114663,Intrusive thoughts suck
176114664,"Try Morningstar Farms Black Bean Burgers. I eat them a few times a week. They are low calorie and they really fill me up. You put them in the microwave for a minute and they’re done. They are vegetarian if that is important to you. They sell them in the freezer section. I second _NAME_’s Kitchen frozen meals. They are more expensive, but you can get one or two a week. I like the pesto tortellini a lot, it fills me up for only 450 calories. For breakfast, I like Quaker Instant Oatmeal. I get the strawberries and cream variety, two packets is only 260 calories and it fills me up until lunch time. I wouldn’t call it dieting either, just changing the way you eat."

174371193,"The collective unconscious is given before every personal experience and contains the general, for all humanity, typical inherited forms of perception and understanding, the so-called archetypes. They represent a huge spiritual legacy of human development. They are footprints of human experience gained over thousands of years in typical, always recurring situations. From this, they appear in the mind of the individual when one such repetition in his or her personal life is repeated. _PERSON_ attached great importance to archetypes. Considering that they existed, both in dreams, fantasies, visions, in artistic creation (especially of great creators), and in the deceptive contents and hallucinations of the mentally ill , _PERSON_ gave them a dominant functional character. Apart from this, _PERSON_ also thought that archetypes possessed a large energy charge."

I have something going on with my nerves and it is pretty scary but I have not been examined yet as I want to make sure it isn’t medication related (appointment for that Thursday). My searching to try and put a name on what is going on with me has made targeted ads pop up for me for some charities for muscular dystrophy but I am seeing MDA.org may not be the best choice for charity but I really don’t know and can use some help. I am fortunate to be employed now and have a bit I want to donate, I just feel like I should while I can because I honestly don’t know if I will be able to work if my issues get worse.

176114702,"Here’s the thing. Even though the voices you hear seem real there just part of your brain gone haywire. So everytime they say stuff to you, just tell them that you know. And that you know what there up to. Eventually with enough repetition it should quiet things down. Ignoring them can make them louder sometimes (my experience) but just a simple acknowledgement of there existence can be enough to get things quiet. Even though I know the voices ‘are not real’ , the experience is still real. It’s like making peace with a bully. You know he’s there but you just want him to go away. In your case the voices are your bully"
174371208,"More fake thought types: Voice-like concepts, or “almost-voices” - I can tell what it says as if it was a voice, but it feels like a fake thought False/true/“the opposite” statements, claiming whether what the preceding voice or fake thought said was true or false, or the opposite of what it said. Not only the fake thoughts, but the voices do that, too. Most often it’s about whether I will be tortured after death, or not. They’ve said I should understand “who” says the truth in such case, because I’m supposed to be a god. Fake conscience - it has a distinct feeling to it, and it says whether I would do something (normally bad thing) or not. Like at one time it claimed that I consented to torturing someone, and if the “spirit” controlling my body would do it, I’d be guilty More typical topics of the inserted thoughts: How I should escape this condition (mostly pointless sayings - things that I can’t do anyway, like believing/trusting certain voices, or obeying commands; I d
on’t get those as often as I used to before) How the “spirit” that controls my body is going to kill me or my mom (I get those pretty much every day) How this condition has ruined my life, or what I could have done if I didn’t get this schizophrenia (mostly when I see things related to what I did earlier)"

176114706,Nope it’s a disassociative It makes me sick every time but still works. If it was an opioid my med naltrexone would completely block it. However instead just makes me sick. The depression aspect works on opioid receptors. But it’s a chemical compound derived in a lab. Last time I did it was feb 12. I didn’t crush it up enough and it hurt my nose. I used it recreationally and it helped medicinally but it sucks like every other illegal drug to me. They’re interesting experiences but just not worth doing in the long run. Ketamine is gaining noterietery as a medicine. For long it’s been a party drug. People will mix it with mdma and go to raives. But now it’s been gaining popularity in medical use. Interested to hear. My friend said it helped his depression for what it’s worth.

There is another volunteer office worker who will be there tomorrow, and they have their big bi-weekly interdisciplinary meetings on Wednesday and Thursday so most people will be in that all day. By Friday there will be more things for me to do. I think I can do this! I know I am ready to start working again, but getting started is kinda rough after 4 1/2 years.

roduce new cells that are not similar to the sperm itself therefore,the sz pathogen does not reproduce/increase numerically ,but it grows cognitively (The egg is the content of the self-knowledge of the human host) The gene repeats itself,the virus reproduces to produce similar virus,but the sz pathogen does not For example,SZ pathogen represented as a parasitic transmitter look like someone speaks and makes a sound (speaker transmitter ) !"

But this whole lockdown situation has also led me to question a lot of things. I can work towards going back to the same workplace. I still have a job there. But I wouldn’t be doing that because I enjoy the job. I hate it. I would only be doing it to face my fears. Going back to a job where I feel people don’t want me. This may or may not be true. The thought of going back is draining my energy. I don’t want to face anyone. But that aside, I feel stuck as I don’t feel there is much for me to achieve professionally, and I was ok with that until recently. I felt personal development was more important and it still is. But now that I think about it, what is wrong about wanting to develop professionally. Isn’t that also part of personal development?

They have a nutrition tracker where you have the option of letting them suggest meals, or you can do what I do and log your own. You can tell the program foods you like or don’t like to make the suggestions more tailored to you In the beginning, logging is a bit time consuming because you don’t have anything on your favorites list, but it doesn’t take long to get that together. You can make food groupings too for recipes so you don’t have to keep logging each ingredient separately. Now that I have that, it only takes me about ten minutes to plan a week’s worth of meals. It tells you all nutrition information so you know each day is within your suggested ranges."

174371240,"You can beat negative symptoms if you follow these. Have daily schedules like sleeping at fixed times, having food at proper times, no nap during day, have regular exercise at least twice a week, bath regularly etc. The reason is negative symptoms cause individual to not do these so you beat them by forcefully following it. Negative symptoms creates cognitive issues like working memory problems. You defeat this by training working memory by doing brain training apps based on working memory like dual n back app. This way always fight against negative symptoms. If you no do anything negative symptoms can make your life miserable."
174371236,"Hi. I think you are confusing symptoms here. Antipsychotics like risperidone and amisulpride (available only in Europe) have side effect of increasing prolactin levels and when prolactin levels are high, men don’t have sexual “needs”. They can ejaculate but simply don’t have sexual drive. On the other hand, antipsychotics like clozapine and sertindole (also available only in Europe) have side effect of men not being able to ejaculate and achieve orgasm. And if ejaculation happens it is often with very small amount of seamen and often not enough for women to become pregnant. Best regards."

I will start - I am currently trying to get to the weight I was before I started Geodon - my short-term weight loss goal is 219 pounds. I am down a total of 63 pounds from my all-time high of 319 when I was on Abilify. I currently weigh 256 pounds (down 12 pounds from when I started Zyprexa in the middle of March). I still have 37 pounds to lose to get to my short-term goal. I track my food intake on Sparkpeople.com - as long as I am less active, I stay between 1200-1400 calories per day. Once I start working, Sparkpeople says I can eat 1200-1550 calories and still lose 2 pounds a week. It was a bit labor intensive to track at first, but now I have my favorite foods in a separate list, and I have food groupings so I can log a meal with one click. It takes me about ten minutes to log a week’s worth of food ahead of time. It’s worth it. I have a collapsed disc in my lumbar spine and can’t do exercis
e that is intense enough to burn calories, so it’s essential that I stick to my calorie range. I walk slowly with a cane, and I hate yoga. I’d rather have a low calorie range. It’s working so far. My long-term weight loss goal is 180 pounds, the weight I was before I started taking anti-psychotics. I will have lost 100 pounds once I hit 219, my short-term goal. My plan is to maintain that for 3 - 6 months before starting the next phase of weight loss. I think I can do it. Anyone else want to join the weight loss thread? I thought it would be good for encouragement and to help us stay on track. Tell me your goals and what you’re doing."

174371263,"Recently I have deduced what orthodox clinicians would reject, but my voices have in the past month or more, failed to repudiate or reject. This seems to be a first for them, with the repugnant hatred and indifference that leads them to hate crimes resulting in multiple suicides, that I call murders, given their expertise. They (he) said, and I know this mans name, “_NAME_, I killed (presided over) a young man last night. He was being berated, and hated as usual, and he was in tears when he undertook to take an overdose of sleeping pills. He was crying solidly as he died, falling asleep eventually for the last time”. (I have had to paraphrase this quote. I can’t quite remember exactly what words he used). I cannot accurately recall the request he (the voices) made of me, but I recall the import of his request, so I say this. And as usual, this is absolutely implausible and entirely impossible to anyone that does not have schizophrenia, rejected by clinicians, but obviously correct to those th
at live with the experience of hearing voices. I have deduced that the voices are humans, but/and they are humans that have a syphilitic type infection - Parent disease: Sexually transmitted infection - causes: Treponema pallidum. In addition to this, they have a personality type the responds affirmatively to cruelty, peer (not group) pressure, pseudo narcissism, and the common human need for distinguishment by elevated self appraisal. However, what happens that leads these people to become perpetrators, is that they live and believe they thrive, in circumstances that they find unexpected and refuted. Their loyalty as bretheren makes them unprepared, and in denial, when confronted with the realisation (and especially coming from me), that they are subject to the same infractions that they use to hate and hurt innocent schizophrenics. But rather than imposing (perpetrating) the acts and simultaneous omissions that cause shaking, crying, terror, hate crimes, twitching, sweating, agony, hot flushes, rimming and 
so on and so on, their bretheren allies ‘zone’ them on the sly through similar acts of betrayal that they commit to schizophrenics. Their temporary group members (temporary cohorts of bretheren), ‘zone’ them with whatever it is they do to schizophrenics, ‘zone’ them with things that cause hatred, violence, violation, enmity, anger, indifference, and other effects that result in them enacting the most savage and vicious behaviour against schizophrenic victim. They do not realise, or as I have found, even suspect, that the larger proportion of their essentially criminal acts that they perform against their schizophrenic victims, are due to the fact that their ‘friend’ has ‘zoned’ them through what they call “a secret communication channel” and done a deed to their brain that makes then act the way they do. It is just like what the movies and press say about being in the mafia. You do these petty criminal ???? like rob someone, or rip off the contents of a truck to begin with. But then in 
time you have to wack someone. So you end up getting a gun and killing some c^&nt. And it crosses your mind that some day, unless you continue to do the crimes demanded of you, you might get wacked yourself. But like in the military, the human condition leads you to live in the ongoing moment that it will not happen to you. But these people, who are as thick as thieves, go along forcing their schizophrenic victims into suicide, or not, know they can not get caught (in the legal sense of the word), and often end up proud of their ability to mutilate both psychologically, psychiatrically, and physically, their victims, never expecting or realising, that their prowess and activities, are to a greater or lesser extent, due to the fact that they are being acted against in a same but different way."

176114970,You said your physical sensations were worse and stuff on 10 mg so looks like 7.5mg is treating you better then. _AT_MENTION_
176114971,Very cool. Hope it goes well for you.
176114972,Nope. Nobody. Nada.
176114973,Yes I have fears too. I don’t like talking about several of them. Some that I don’t mind mentioning are: fear of med resistance. Fear of heights. Fear of ocean depths. Fear of having children. Fear of planes Fear of driving Fear of ships Fear of snakes

176114976,That was a big step :). Good job!
176114977,Actually the guns and roses guy is called slash lol! I got it wrong
176114978,"Yep and I was scared. I said,”who are you? Go away.” I also dreamed that looked sorta like a pig but was called something else but wasn’t a pig. It hung out at McDonald’s and eventually died bc no one would help it."
176114979,"What if you start thinking it’s fake, your mind is lying to you, it’s not real, etc.?"
176114980,"True story. Mundane, everyday tasks we usually take for granted and perform unthinkingly have become greatly magnified of lately, gigantic quests undertaken in order to achieve the insignificant. Drinking tea means worrying about every other cup of tea I’ve yet to drink, every mug I must wash, the imperfections involved in any human action. Simple tasks have become monumental challenges, devoid however, of any of the glamour we typically associate with the latter. Can you relate to this?"
176114981,Can you not take a supplement and your meds together? I don’t see why not! Your doctors office may be closed but on the answering service there should be an option to speak with someone on call.
174371286,"Low IQ? Maybe, _USER_ID_ about noticing the patterns on those IQ tests so my score is low. On the other hand i write pretty good stuff and have been praised for my stories from many of my english teachers. Im also a 5kyu at the game Go, which takes about 1 to 2 years of constant play to get that good. Im also pretty good at working with electronics. I also almost finished 2 University degrees before all the strange occurances. Thing is, the reason im still living at home with disability is because i got doxxed and hacked about 2 years ago. It caused alot of stress anyways. I also got to experience military grade weapons testing on me or supernatural things, im still not sure what it is. Only, you cant really prove all the things i claim. No one would believe me if i said i saw small objects moving around me(like my lighter moving by itself and other small objects), lights burning out when i would go into a trance or telepathy. So im stuck with a schizophrenia diagnosis, mostly because i rant to my 
psychiatrist for long periods about the things that have happened to me, paranormal things. I dont mind tho. It might be curable if there was a way to regenerate the brain tissue and create more grey matter to combat the illness. Tho there is alot of factors besides “the brain” that happens to people with schizophrenia."
176114982,Probably just a coincidence although I have had similar experiences. They can be convincing.
174371285,"I had a lot of anxiety due to severe dissociation, depersonalization etc. When i read about the “Minimal self” - _NAME_ and his college, _NAME_ writing about selfdisturbances in sz i understood my symptoms better, and got a big relieve. Im not alone. My minimal self is a fluid, ever changing entity between persons, history, the phenomena, and “the others.” If there is an ago, it’s just popping up momentarily from this strange dream."
174371282,I don’t have it (at least not yet). But i prefer the term ‘person with schizophrenia’.
176114983,"What do you mean you came up with these ideas yourself? You’ve referenced The Matrix, Westworld, Lost, now the _NAME_ conspiracy. And many, many others. Not manufactured by your mind, absorbed from others. If you abstained from these triggers, I believe you’d get better."
176114984,I don’t think I have that… I might have done that once to get my dad to stay at the time But I don’t have that now… I may have it in subtle ways that I don’t know about… But I don’t think so _PERSON_ actually physically sick and mentally ill Im going to apply for low income housing Since I’ll be moving out my partners place… I need to get my needs met
176114985,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ . I’m still cycling downward a bit but no longer feeling like harming myself. I may call my psychiatrist if it continues.

176114988,"I am just having a hard time lately, my memory is bad compared to what it used to be and I have trouble thinking and processing things as they occur. I have some moments when I am more aware than others and in the moment but every day my focus is different and I am a bit disconnected but not completely, if that makes sense. I am trying to figure out if I am getting worse but I don’t know in what way to judge that, I feel like I am getting worse but then again it isn’t delusional or psychotic thinking just poorer quality, fuzzier at times. I need some people who know what I am feeling to help me out of they can, I don’t really like this."

176114997,"The military is less misogynistic than regular society. In fact, the military has been, and continues to be, at the forefront of equality in regards to women, people of color, and LGBTQ people. Everyone in the Army wears the same uniform. A soldier is a soldier."

176115000,"Kind of forced to until I win the lottery. I suppose it would help if I bought a ticket, but still."
176115001,Saw my psychiatrist earlier today and I gave her the details of my depressive episodes and high anxiety. I told her that I was stressed out to the max. I told her about my suicidal thoughts that day and she strongly suggested I immediately go back on Depakote ER. I agreed with her because Depakote has been a tried and true drug for me over decades of using it in the past. My hat goes off to _AT_MENTION_ for suggesting that I go back on Depakote. I know that I’ll probably gain some more weight but I’ll continue to follow my low carb diet that my nutritionist ordered. I guess it’s better to be fat and alive then skinny and dead. She said that I don’t have to rely on the Klonopin as much now that I’ll be back on the Depakote. She also wants me to take charge of my life more and drive more often when I can. She feels that if I take charge of my life more I’ll feel better about myself. I ordered the Depakote from the pharmacy right away and it should arrive at my house in a couple of days. In 
the meantime I have some extra Depakote in the house that I’ll immediately take tonight. She is certain that Depakote does not cause fatty liver. But I’m going to have to continue watching my weight. _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_

The only pieces that aren’t stored were bootlegged by _USER_ID_ _PERSON_ who is also now mostly working from home - she needs the kit for her teaching setup.

174371290,"“Aripiprazole produced significant improvements in positive and negative symptoms in short- and long-term studies of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Improvements occurred rapidly after the start of treatment, and were sustained throughout studies lasting up to 52 weeks.

176115034,It’s hard for people to understand what we go through. They think it can “go away” or maybe be cured. My mom just today said ‘are you taking vitamin c?’ I said no mom. Then she said that’s why your not doing well. Then says something like prayers do get answered and I’ll say yeah Ive been waiting 13 years now for it to go away lol and say I just gotta manage my symptoms. Geee thanks mom . She means well she just worries and cares and that’s how it come out. I love my mom. She just doesn’t understand and that’s okay. If I wasn’t mentally ill I’d probably not understand either.

176115047,I just can’t trust anyone. I came to the realization that my trust issues are more severe than it has ever been. I just think people can’t be trusted at all because they’re all evil. I seriously need to get out of this trauma. I can’t be trapped in memories that happened 10+ years ago. I don’t even trust my family and I don’t even know if I can trust my friends. What is even going on with me?
174371298,"Oh honey, that’s not good. You need an ap, a mood stabilizer, and an ad. This is just too hard to do without a chemical help. You’re out blowing in the wind with no protection and anything could happen. It’s just not safe. I really think you need to make an appointment with a pdoc and get some stuff going. It’s too hard without. I take saphris, rexulti, Topamax and Cymbalta and it’s a really good balance for me. I’m a little on the sad side sometimes but that’s ok, better than being manic because I make better choices when I’m not manic. And right now I’m looking to go back to work after 8 years of disability. So the meds are doing pretty good.

174371316,Look. It isn’t common and benzo withdrawal is a totally different problem. I’m not arguing it’ll make a difference coming off it but it’s not withdrawal that is the issue for zyprexa. I take that. What you say then…because you’ve changed your story three times already is that abilify probably isn’t the issue anyways. Titrating down off meds is always good.

Hearing voices isn’t normal functioning, it’s usually a sign of poor sleep or a form of psychosis; medication would help you in the long run. Because if the voices get particularly intrusive, you may well lose your own voice in the head is how I would describe it. How many years are you there for? Is this your first year?"

As schizophrenics I think we are especially vulnerable to self medicating with things that alter our dopamine levels which adds difficulty to an already hard problem."

176115099,It made me angry and didn’t help in anything.
176115100,"I can’t move out. I can’t hold a job right now so I’m on disability. I live with my mom and she and all my doctors agree that I should just stick with going to school part time for now. I don’t care about power, all I want is to be treated like a human being. So, according to you, I don’t deserve to be respected because I chose to use the f-bomb during a rant on an anonymous internet forum? That’s idiotic. It’s not like I’m sitting here cursing out my mom. I’m not going to hurt my mom. That’s not what this is about. I want her to treat me like a human, like I treat her."
176115101,"No mood most of the day. I have sz, not sza."
176115102,My dad said so and my mom too.
176115103,I had some great meditations today. Very relaxing. I got to spend time with my fiancée. I was able to resist going to get beer.
176115104,Yes it’s for my tummy trouble.
176115105,People change. Maybe try to get to know yourself as you are now and don’t worry about who you used to be.
176115106,"_PERSON_, You’re hilarious, hon!"
176115107,I have a Samsung s8 included in my plan. Otherwise I’d never be able to afford it. I’m not sure how it works where you are.
176115108,Reaching out for help takes a lot of bravery. I don’t know what’s going on with you but I hope you’ll be ok.
176115109,"I think it sends a bad signal if you pull out a switch and start playing. Mobile games are eaiser to hide, and I think they’re ok for killing time. But if I was the boss and I saw one of my employees just gaming when they could have been doing work related stuff, I wouldn’t be happy about it, to put it that way."
174371307,"if you have one psychotic episode, it could be not schizophrenia but just a brief psychotic episode, or schizophreniform, or maybe stress or something else. if you have two beyond a six months period, you are technically schizophrenic (or bipolar, and again unless there’s another medical issue) and probably needs meds for life. but even then, a large portion of schizophrenics dont even need meds, i’m thinking like maybe one in four ive heard. so any way you cut it, it seems like the only way you can know for sure, unless you are a really bad case or still have symptoms on meds, is to see how you do without meds."
176115110,Yeah I was scared that my sister’s kid caused a fire cuz they were playing with matchsticks
176115111,"Can I cancel the appointment and be done with invega poisoning, get my life back and feel sane again? Not worry about them going to measures (whatever that may be) to force medication?"
174371310,"My Dad has a lot of Masonic stuff in his family, although he never joined. For some reason I’ve always been facinated by Freemasons. I was sure one of the reasons why I was being targeted was because he has a rhesus negative blood type, which is the blood type of the elite and reptilians. The tageting has started up again, but everyone says it is because I came off my meds. I’ve been back on them a couple of weeks now. I don’t have fun when I stop taking them, I just hate the side effects. I’m back to having insomnia now because of the aripiprazole."
176115112,You have sza or sz? Or psychosis with a mood disorder?
176115113,"Probably, the doctor said it was just like a risperidone pill and that itll have less side effects. It works out ok for me, less side effects compared to the pill. Clears my head enough"
176115114,"Yeah, I can track with that for sure."
176115115,That sucks 151515
176115116,_AT_MENTION_ you got taken. I’m sorry…my book cost $700 to self publish…try iuniverse next time …too late I know…sorry…
176115117,"that person should not have done that, i dont see any reason for it, its very strange"
176115118,I thought I was part of it and that they came to pick me up in a black tainted car infront of my house. I was up all night looking at it.
176115119,"There are so many antipsychotic drugs. Probably, there are options out there that cause less sedation and/or negative symptoms. -_NAME_."

174371314,Damn. I wonder if I’m ultra resistant too. I took sodium benzoate and it helped but I get scared about cancer. Things seem to have diminished returns with me.
176115123,I’m starting to get use to it honestly
174371323,I came off it after 10 years of absolutely no psychosis. And I ended up psychotic granted it was because they gave me antidepressants that didn’t agree with me but I don’t advise it
176115124,For yesterday: No cancer detected on tests I’ve taken so far and my symptoms of pain and discomfort have eased off and do not feel as bad. I have started wearing makeup and it felt good to put red lipstick on just before I went in to have my cancer tests taken n I thought the thought of dying with lipstick on. It does add some colour when one is not feeling well.i need to buy more mascara soon. My father called to ask how I am and how the tests went.that ment a lot to me.
176115125,I think so… has been right about a lot of things.
176115126,Left ear? 15141t
176115127,Thanks to all of you for your replies and sympathy.
176115128,"that’s good _AT_MENTION_ . My therapist talked about how I shouldn’t compare either, yesterday. Maybe therapists wake up and read the daily therapeutic tips column lol!"
176115129,gotta keep 'em all guessing. Never be too pegged.
176115130,Sorry to hear the Abilify didn’t work for you. Same happened to me - one way trip to hospital and no drivers license for a further 6 months!
176115131,I was told it’s because of my condition but yes you might be right. Also…I’m getting really sleepy so I’ll get back to you tomorrow morning. Is that ok?
176115132,"Thanks for the article, it says this and that meds play a smaller preventable role: “Important causal factors are related to lifestyle, including poor diet, lack of physical activity, smoking, and substance abuse…Many pharmacological agents used for treating psychotic disorders have side effects augmenting CVD risk. Although several CVD-risk factors can be effectively prevented and treated…”"
176115133,"Look back on all your dreams in the past. Didn’t most of them make no sense and didn’t most of them not mean anything? Well, this current dream is probably the same. Don’t read into it."

176115135,Yes. Sorry for acting up. I just been stressed.

176115137,"When I was in hospital two years ago,I noticed only few people that are hardly managing to keep them inside,and not speak gibberish.I just recalled and laughed how folks there only problem was food and lack of erection. Once I told my aunt at her place that when I talk to her I hear intense voices.Wanted her to know my daily “program” ."
176115138,Wow. What a read
176115139,"Yeah. My primary dr has tried to get me off some stuff but I always end up needing it. My urologist has me on a lot too, and then there’s my pulmonologist and gastroenterologist … you get the picture. Ugh!"

I have three tablets that are on my prescription, and I have access to benzos and other AP’s for sleep and anxiety etc. I know medication doesn’t solve everything, but it’s helpful if you’re just getting so overwhelmed and need a break"
176115145,It’s such a powerful med that even at 2.5mg I may still feel shitty. I hope that will not b the case
176115146,"Yes, it’s very difficult if not impossible to treat this “diminished self.” Medicine cant change who you are, only the symptoms, but this is not a symptom it’s the way you are. You can try not to be scared of this feeling or just ignore it. But it’s difficult, i haven’t found a solution to this problem. I just live with it. and _AT_MENTION_ - i wish i had a psychiatrist like that, mine is okay, but we only talk meds. I guess we all are actors, and you do a pretty good job acting like seksoempirico"

174371324,"In your mind you’re not sick. You play semantics. You _NAME_ pick some instances, ie these ideas are just ones I give too much attention Too; therefore, it makes you feel like you’re in control of these ideas, it brings you comfort. You think, Ideas are had by ordinary people therefore I’m not sick, I’m ordinary. I just have a problem with ideas. Why would someone overvalue ideas that are not logical; that resemble delusional thinking? These are not ordinary ideas. You separate each instance into your compartmentalized views of reality and minimize some while denying others. You reinforce your views by defining what over valued ideas are and somehow you escape your diagnosis. You play Dr. _PERSON_ on the internet thinking a lay persons point of view trumps a specialists evidence based conclusions. Evidence leads to facts. According to you none of us are schizophrenic we all just overvalue non logical Ideas. What do you call instances that are non logical and out of touch with reality?"

176115151,Wow. Expansion of the “paranasal sinuses” Good find.
176115152,I’m feeling a little better this morning. I am praying that I will not victimize the weak. Because I am smart enough to know that I can hurt someone if I let the evil in me have its way.
176115153,That’s an antidepressant. I don’t think it will do anything for anxiety but I have never tried it. I take Wellbutrin also.

174371325,I’m having dizziness and fatigue from the Abilify I started 2 weeks ago. Anyone have any idea how long it usually takes for side effects to resolve? I know I may always have side effects but I’m hoping they go away eventually.
174371333,"I think so, it looks to me as if they have tested it on an EEG dataset. Which is not invalid - but also sounds early stage."
176115167,"I was slightly strange. I had not logical ideas, sometimes misinterpreting words, ideas and emotions. Maybe sz is genetic and we have it since we are born idk it shares lots of genes with autism and intellectual disability I read."
174371330,I was put on abilify. There’s a discmelt version of the abilify pill that disintegrates in your mouth so you don’t even have to swallow it. That’s what I was given. I was psychotic and thought I was actually dead and this was an afterlife pill and that’s the way pills worked in the afterlife. They just disappeared in your mouth without having to swallow them.
174371322,"I am hesitant for 3 reasons. Every med that lessons positive symptoms, also can cause TD. I have a low energy problem to start with. Reading this has caused visions of my psychiatrist, shaking uncontrollably, telling me not to try it."

176115199,Finally saw a ‘doctor’ at the horrible low-cost mental health place and all it was was another frikin evaluation? I ALREADY ANSWERED THE SAME QUESTIONS FROM THE DAMN CASE WORKER. WHATS DRIVING ME MAD IS: WHY ARE SO MANY CHOOSING TO AVOID EMOTIONAL ISSUES AND CHOOSING TO BE SO DAMN ROBOTIC AND THEN ACTING AS IF THEY CANT UNDERSTAND WHY SO MUCH OF THE WORLD IS THE WAY IT IS? NO ONE IS TELLING YOU TO GO ALONG WITH THIS SYSTEM BUT YOUR DAMN EGOS. BY NOT QUESTIONING THESE THINGS WITH HONESTY YOU ARE ENCOURAGING MORE UNNECCESSARY SUFFERING! BEING DISREGARDED FOR MY PAINFULLY ACCURATE PERCEPTION OF THINGS IS MADDENING BEYOND WORDS! WHO WOULDN’T WANT TO LOSE IT IN THIS EMOTIONALLY AVOIDANT WORLD? I FEEL LIKE EVERY OPTION IS CRAP BECAUSE IT GOES AGAINST CONSCIENCE TO CHOOSE THINGS THAT ARE ALL A LOSS! THEN … PEOPLE ASK “WHY ARE PEOPLE CREATING VIOLENCE AND KILLING THEMSELVES?” AS IF THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING… ITS BECAUSE YOU REFUSE TO BE HONEST! NEARLY EVERYONE IS DISHONEST TO SOME EXTENT! BUT 
BEING DISHONEST ABOUT NEGATIVE EMOTIONS IS MAKING IT HARDER TO CONNECT TO ANYONE GENUINELY OF AFFECTIONATELY/INTIMATELY AT ALL! AND THE PAINFUL IGNORANCE OF PEOPLE TRYING TO COVER AND AVOID NEGATIVE EMOTIONS WITH POSITIVE BULLCRAP! YOU ARE NOT A BENEFACTOR TO ANYONE! MORE SO ARE THOSE WHO WANT TO ‘PROTECT’ PEOPLE FROM ‘NEGATIVE’ THINGS BY FORCING THINGS THAT THEY DONT LIKE OUT OF THE PICTURE. PEACE CANNOT BE KEPT BY FORCE! YOU ARE ALSO NOT CONTRIBUTING TO A HEALTHIER/HONEST/LOVING WORLD! YOU ARE ENCOURAGING MORE VIOLENCE AND SWEEPING OF THINGS UNDER THE RUG! UNTIL IT IS DISCOVERED AGAIN!

That’s 40 years of weird thoughts and perceptions but even at my worst when I was psychotic for two years straight, a part of me was perfectly rational and sane. It used to freak out doctors, lol. But this morning I was really thinking, am I mad? I was really doubting my sanity, I thought am I actually, really insane. Never had such deep self doubts. I was taking a shower before work as usual. I’ve never heard voices but I kept thinking I heard faint laughter from the neighbor lady. They do stuff like that. It’s so subtle and timed so perfectly but I couldn’t quite put my finger on whether I was imagining it or that maybe this woman is so sadistic and psychotic that she would do this to someone. I’ve been through a lot but now I’m having doubts. It’s not just today, I hear them laughing occasionally. Gotta go."
176115251,_AT_MENTION_ had a 2 year old girl and she was acting up and got into some or her lotion so she sprayed it all over her face to teach her a lesson only no one saw her do it and everyone assumed the 2 year old just got it on herself. But I knew better. I wanted to confront ninjastar but the timing wasn’t right because other things were going on. So after awhile I made this really dramatic ordeal about child abuse and how you have to teach by respect and I couldn’t talk very well due to some mystery disability I had. But none the less I made my point somehow and ninjastar cried and was very sorry for spraying the baby with lotion. Then she smiled and told me how awesome I was and how much she loved me while laying on this hammock. Then _AT_MENTION_ came in and found out ninjastar’s true identity and I swore it wasn’t from me. She said it must have been from another member who needed the suicide hotline numbers and I agreed. JustTrish promised not to say a word. That’s when I woke up.

174371344,"Hi _NAME_ hope you are doing well also. I’m not too bad just very anxious still even though I am taking a small dose of lyrica. My psychiatrist told me I have somataform disorder because I was convinced I had MS even though several neurologists told me I had not. I still think I have some type of MS although not as strongly as before. Maybe the abilify is helping that. He told me I was bordering on being delusional. What meds are you taking? I’m not sure the ones I am taking are for somataform disorder although I have severe anxiety and depression too, so together maybe that’s why I’m on these meds. 225mg effexor, 10mg abilify, 300mg quetiapine and 50mg lyrica. I also have sleep apeona. Mild. I use CPAP. I never feel refreshed. Always drowsy and wobbly and clumsy. My thoughts race a lot, and I do have bad visual thoughts as well as thinking my neighbor’s can read my thoughts and are watching me, plus recording me. I dont have schizophrenia my psychiatrist told me so I’m just doing what 
they say and trying to get better. I’m certainly doing better on the meds except for the anxiety part. I’m more motivated and interested. Hope this lasts. Due to see Doc on Tuesday . I dont know why we somatise, it could be from past traumas maybe? I really dont know. I need to have therapy doc said, as in attend home based crisis team and that he alone isn’t enough so I need a team sort of. I see a regular psychiatrist in the same clinic I attend my care worker. So that’s the home based crisis part, the team. I probably need to see a psychologist as well they said. For now its seeing the psychiatrist who I like and he is good as well plus my care worker twice a week. My original psychiatrist I will also see in February for an update on how I’m getting on at the clinic. They liaison as well with him. Basically need to follow all they say and try to help myself as much as I can and take my meds."
176115256,"I have been seeking help with some occasional thoughts of suicide. I looked for movies that would help me. I found one, which I just watched, called, “An Inspector Calls” (2015). It is about an interrogation into what events in a person’s life could have warranted suicide. I realized that I myself don’t really have strong reasons to commit suicide. The movie has me thinking. Perhaps for me it is the apathy, lack of things to do, and depression. I got some positive insight from this movie. I hope I am able to ward off future thoughts of suicide."

At school I started reading. The first thing I would do when I woke up was grab a book, and I read until I went to sleep at night. I was totally alone, and it was pure happiness. I have tried to duplicate that experience since then, and all the reading just bored me. Right now I am moderately happy. I read very little. I spend a lot of time on my computer.

176115346,"Reasons it might for me. Worried about what i think/say if someones listening in. Wanting to appear normal to strangers and pseudo-acquaintances (ex: lying to a neighbour i work when i dont). I just realized i put in a lot of effort to seem normal, as im sure many of you do as well. Feels like i have to lie or exaggerate what im doing in life to not draw attention to the fact im half way to being a bum. Even with people that know im sz, i still lie to them, not professionals -just people (pseudo-friends). Thoughts?"
176115347,I’m sorry you’re suffering so much _AT_MENTION_. I know how hard it is to motivate oneself. Most of the time I don’t do much either but because I’m married I have to look after my husband. He motivates me to do things but yes it’s f***ing hard. I get this empty feeling almost every day. The depression / negatives keep on coming back. I don’t know how to get out of it. But I guess it’s about forcing oneself to do things. Not that I do that - I tend to wait till a good day comes. Or just do as much as I can in the day. Usually I only clean house when the dust and dirt look bad and I get disgusted at it. Then that makes me want to clean it.

174371373,"CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that L-theanine is effective in ameliorating positive symptoms and sleep quality in schizophrenia. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effect of L-theanine on glutamatergic function in patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Acta neuropsychiatrica , Oct 2015 Glutamatergic dysfunction in the brain has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous studies suggested that L-theanine affects the glutamatergic neurotransmission and ameliorates symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the present study were twofold: to examine the possible effects of L-theanine on symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients and to evaluate the changes in chemical mediators, including glutamate + glutamine (Glx), in the brain by using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).The subjects were 17 patients with schizophrenia and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. L-theanine (250 mg/day) was ad
ded to the patients' ongoing antipsychotic treatment for 8 weeks. The outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores and MRS results.There were significant improvements in the PANSS positive scale and sleep quality after the L-theanine treatment. As for MRS, we found no significant differences in Glx levels before and after the 8 week L-theanine treatment. However, significant correlations were observed between baseline density of Glx and change in Glx density by l-theanine.Our results suggest that L-theanine is effective in ameliorating positive symptoms and sleep quality in schizophrenia. The MRS findings suggest that L-theanine stabilises the glutamatergic concentration in the brain, which is a possible mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect."

176115449,"I was in two private hospitals first and they were awesome. Good food, friendly staff and occupational therapy. Then I went twice to state hospital. It wasn’t too bad. Also had good facilities and therapy activities. I was pretty out of it on the second occasion though and was discharged after five days to continue treatment at home. Then seven years later in 2013 I went to an open therapeutic ward at another state hospital and it was good too. Lots of activities and I benefitted a lot from that stay - five weeks with weekends at home. Sixth time was at a general state hospital in a locked psych ward and it was incredibly boring and then I was transferred to the same state psych hospital I was in but not the therapeutic ward this time but the locked ward. Then went to two wards after that. Had to wear hospital clothing like prison almost. This stay (my sixth) was ok but I was scared in the locked ward as there were patients really out of it. One lady kept undressing herself and some others got in
to fights but fortunately not with me. The other two wards were nice. Got bored though as there wasn’t a lot of therapy. The seventh time was a brief stay in the general hospital overnight ward. Went home after four days. Eighth time was back in general hospital in psych ward. Incredibly boring and there was this lady who freaked me out looking at me with near threats. Fortunately I was transferred soon after to the state psych hospital where I spent five days in locked ward. More naked ladies and this elderly lady who kept on screaming at people “F*** you!” if they came too near to her. And finally ninth and tenth time in same general hospital psych ward. One of those times there was another lady who stood over my bed and watched me freaking me out. She had to be restrained as she was irritating everyone else. All in all I felt hospital was a safe place but sometimes scary especially when I was very ill and frightened and missing my husband. And very boring indeed."

176115467,They don’t have the technology and you are constantly trying to prove your delusions. It’s a subtle thing but you need to take the meds and move from there. You are wasting time chasing shadows. There’s no substance to any of your fears which clearly points to delusions. Please seek medical help immediately.

What’s up with these people? I could understand that maybe some of my efforts are trying to get something for nothing. Just occsionally.

176115532,"If you have done nothing illegal then the cops would not be after you. When they see you driving you are nothing special to them, just one of a couple hundred people they see every day. I heard a cop once say that they actually see so many good drivers every day because when anyone sees a cop they usually are going to slow down and drive carefully and be on their best behavior. And just for the record, I think it’s normal to be a little nervous when you’re driving and you see a cop. On rare occasions a blinker bulb goes out or you might unconsciously be speeding or not stop completely at a stop sign and you could get pulled over. But just drive safely and keep your car legal and chances are they will let you alone. But the cops are not singling you out or looking for you personally.They have no reason to. Cops even overlook minor traffic offenses sometimes if the person looks like a responsible, average citizen. They have bigger fish to fry, like people committing real crimes."

176115608,"I have been on and off Abilify. It works well while I’m on it. Off it, I get hospitalized. It took me about three to four months to get used to it. Initially, I had insomnia, anxiety, nightmares, irritability, and some psychosis still. After six months, I felt a whole lot better. Now, I sleep like a baby on it. I was really eager to take it because nothing else worked for me or the side effects were really bad. It is not as potent as Zyprexa or Clozapine but it is effective about 95 percent of the time for my psychosis. Right now, I hear some voices again but know they will go away with time as long as I take my medication. The side effects of Abilify are not as bad as the other meds. I am still chubby and sleepy at times but can work on these if I wanted. I am doing burpees now and drinking coffee. I feel fine for the most part. I work and am independent. Nobody is helping me. I do know some medications are just trial and error. So, what works for me may not work for everybody else. Best wishes!

174371450,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Prevalence of Non-Affective Psychoses in Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Systematic Review. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, GL D'Alò, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, Journal of clinical medicine , Aug 24 2019 Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and non-affective psychoses such as schizophrenia are commonly acknowledged as discrete entities. Previous research has revealed evidence of high comorbidity between these conditions, but their differential diagnosis proves difficult in routine clinical practice due to the similarities between core symptoms of each disorder. The prevalence of comorbid non-affective psychoses in individuals with ASD is uncertain, with studies reporting rates ranging from 0% to 61.5%. We therefore performed a systematic review and pooled analysis of the available studies reporting the prevalence of non-affective psychosis in ASD. Fourteen studies, including a total of 1708 participants, were included, with a weighted pooled prevalence assessed at 9.5% 
(95% CI 2.6 to 16.0). In view of significant heterogeneity amongst the studies, subgroup analyses were conducted. We observed higher prevalence of non-affective psychoses among ASD inpatients versus outpatients, when operationalised criteria were used, and in studies with smaller sample sizes, whereas the figures were comparable between children and adults with ASD. Our results suggest that future studies involving larger samples should implement both operationalized criteria and specific scales for the assessment of psychotic symptoms in individuals with ASD. A deeper understanding of both differential and comorbid features of ASD and non-affective psychosis will be required for the development of optimized clinical management protocols."

They showed us each in turn That Water would certainly wet us, as Fire would certainly burn: But we found them lacking in Uplift, Vision and Breadth of Mind, So we left them to teach the Gorillas while we followed the March of Mankind. We moved as the Spirit listed. They never altered their pace, Being neither cloud nor wind-borne like the Gods of the Market Place, But they always caught up with our progress, and presently word would come That a tribe had been wiped off its icefield, or the lights had gone out in Rome. With the Hopes that our World is built on they were utterly out of touch, They denied that the Moon was _PERSON_; they denied she was even Dutch; They denied that Wi
shes were Horses; they denied that a Pig had Wings; So we worshipped the Gods of the Market Who promised these beautiful things. When the Cambrian measures were forming, They promised perpetual peace. They swore, if we gave them our weapons, that the wars of the tribes would cease. But when we disarmed They sold us and delivered us bound to our foe, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “Stick to the Devil you know.” On the first Feminian Sandstones we were promised the Fuller Life (Which started by loving our neighbour and ended by loving his wife) Till our women had no more children and the men lost reason and faith, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “The Wages of Sin is Death.” In the Carboniferous Epoch we were promised abundance for all, By robbing selected _NAME_ to pay for collective _NAME_; But, though we had plenty of money, there was nothing our money could buy, And the Gods of the Copybook Headings said: “If you don’t work you die.” Then the Gods of the Market tumbled, 
and their smooth-tongued wizards withdrew And the hearts of the meanest were humbled and began to believe it was true That All is not Gold that Glitters, and Two and Two make Four And the Gods of the Copybook Headings limped up to explain it once more. As it will be in the future, it was at the birth of Man There are only four things certain since Social Progress began. That the Dog returns to his Vomit and the Sow returns to her Mire, And the burnt Fool’s bandaged finger goes wabbling back to the Fire; And that after this is accomplished, and the brave new world begins When all men are paid for existing and no man must pay for his sins, As surely as Water will wet us, as surely as Fire will burn, The Gods of the Copybook Headings with terror and slaughter return!

But I can’t unsee all the paranormal stuff I experienced… the people reaction that experienced with me was very genuine, as if they experienced it with me too. But I don’t remember anything because I felt like a split personality took over. Did you beat schizophrenia?"

174371467,"Ok so there are dopamine channels in your brain. They are like gateways that let dopamine in. Someone with psychosis has a ton of dopamine flooding in through those gates. A dopamine antagonist closes these gates. The issue is that we do need dopamine or we get things like movement disorders, worse negative symptoms, etc. A partial agonist, like abilify, still closes the gates, but not as much as a full antagonist would. The idea here is that because it does not completely block out dopamine it would be less likely to cause movement disorders and worsened negative symptoms. But since you are still greatly reducing the amount of dopamine, it should still help with positive symptoms."

176115739,"Hello _NAME_, Well, I went looking for why my family get ill so much. I looked at blood tests and urine tests and symptoms. I tended to ignore schizopnrenia research entirely and look only at pure metabolic research. I arrived at the conclusion that various parts of my metabolism/genes probably had altered function. I looked for a point of contact between these areas. I arrived at EGLN3. From a purely personal point of view, only then did I find the links that I have referred to above between Parkinson’s and EGLN genes, and schizopnrenia and EGLN genes and anemia and EGLN genes. All of which happen to apply to my family. To me, this is very significant evidence, because statistically, the chances of my arriving at EGLN3 and finding how closely connected it is to schizopnrenia must be incredibly low. But I have not referred to this in my earlier post because it is personal information and a doctor has yet to confirm the link between my family and EGLN3, so the weight a stranger would give to this 
should be very low."

The same can’t be said for mental illness, where treatments may well dramatically improve within a patient’s lifetime. As well, when you research suicide repeat rates or the testimony of suicide survivors, it’s a pretty bleak picture for the times it succeeds. Nearly every person that attempts says that the moment past the point they would have been able to take it back there was an immediate regret over the attempt. 9/10 never attempt again. It’s a horrible choice to end up making, and I don’t think it should be on the table except in the cases where it is purely skipping a very painful and drawn out inevitability. And with the rate of research in study of the brain, I think a life of unchanging treatment options for any mental illness is far from inevitable, as difficult as the present may be for some."

I used to believe aliens put them in my head, but that belief went away and I started to see it as a brain malfunction.They don’t really seem like voices but for a long time I could not believe that they are my thoughts, so I thought maybe there’s no term for this kind of thing yet. I’m starting to cave in and consider these words thoughts, yet the feeling I have whenever they go through my head is that I don’t believe/agree with the content of these thoughts. Usually these thoughts are specific insults that seem to be about me. It happens throughout the day and is very repetitive, not a lot of variation. They don’t seem to happen if I’m in the middle of doing something, maybe a little but only if I zone out for a second.

It’s the concept of not needing to be faster than the bear just faster than the other guy trying to outrun the bear. As a schizophrenic there are obvious risks undertaken by the employer when hiring us. We may not be disabled in so far as our inability to do the job but more so in that we are less hireable than non schizophrenic people.

The present study 
was to examine potential benefits of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to improve negative symptoms and cognition in this patient population. Methods: The study was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind sham-controlled trial. Patients with schizophrenia were treated with adjunctive 20-Hz rTMS for 4 weeks or sham condition to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Negative symptoms were measured using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and the Positive and Negative symptom scale (PANSS) negative subscale at baseline and week 4. Cognitive function was measured using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) at the same two time points. In addition, possible moderators for rTMS treatment efficacy were explored. Results: Sixty patients (33 in the treatment group, 27 in the sham group) completed the study. There was a significant decrease in negative symptoms after 4-week rTMS treatment as measured by the SANS total score and the PANSS negative symptom subscale s
core. However, there was no significant improvement in cognition with rTMS treatment. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis suggested that the baseline severity of positive symptoms may predict poorer improvement in negative symptoms at week 4. Conclusion: Twenty-Hz rTMS stimulation over left DLPFC as an adjunctive treatment might be beneficial in improving negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Future studies with a longer treatment duration and a larger sample size are needed. Clinical trial ID: NCT_PHONE_NO_.

174371525,"This is a different protien found to be reduced only in specific areas of the brain in SZ. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov SMAD4 protein is decreased in the dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices in schizophrenia. AS _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _NAME_, The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry, Feb 21 2020 SMADs are a family of signal transduction factors that mediate signalling of the TGFB-superfamily of cell regulatory proteins. A recent transcriptomic analysis of post-mortem, cortical tissue from subjects with schizophrenia found decreased mRNA expression of SMAD2 and SMAD4 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) associated with the disorder. To expand this initial finding, we sought to determine whether SMAD2 and SMAD4 protein were also altered in the cortex from subjects with schizophrenia.Western blotting was used to measure SMAD2 and SMAD4 protein levels in DLPFC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) taken 
post-mortem from subjects with schizophrenia (n?=?20) and matched control (n?=?20) subjects.Compared to controls, levels of SMAD4 were 25% lower in the DLPFC and 38% lower in the ACC from subjects with schizophrenia. By contrast, SMAD2 levels were not altered in either DLPFC or ACC.Our finding of lower SMAD4 protein in the cortex suggests there are likely to be abnormalities in cortical TGFB-superfamily signalling in schizophrenia."

But what if we manage at some point in the future to create a simulation of our own that includes self-conscious beings not unlike ourselves with no awareness (at least not initially) that they are living in a simulation? Would that fact weaken your initial intuition that we don’t live in a simulation?

I’ve had a hard enough time with my fast food job, but that’s just dealing with food, not people’s lives. I don’t want anyone to get hurt as a result of my mind not working as it should.

Now the problem with that is that their thought are peculiar because theirs no background to proof them. My way of thinking is way different where my thoughts are brought up from history and my pass evidence. See my thoughts are more like ‘what so’ where there’s some room for ‘maybe’ and so on.

I feel it’s very evil and being around it or having to look at it makes me uncomfortable. Like when my husband wears a red shirt it sticks out to me and I don’t want to be around it but I don’t say anything. I might buy something with say a red thread in it but I always know it’s there. There’s no red in my decor at all bc I won’t buy it. Tried to rationalize etc but no change. Could be worse I guess. My hubby thinks it’s funny Could be part of my schizotypal

176115954,EurekAlert! Brain researchers seek 'fingerprints' of severe mental diseases McLean Hospital investigates brain network connectivity in patients with psychotic disorders.
174371544,"There’s some evidence that the supplement L-theanine can help improve sleep in people with schizophrenia. I use it. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Effect of L-theanine on glutamatergic function in patients with schizophrenia. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Acta neuropsychiatrica , Oct 2015 Glutamatergic dysfunction in the brain has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Previous studies suggested that L-theanine affects the glutamatergic neurotransmission and ameliorates symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the present study were twofold: to examine the possible effects of L-theanine on symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients and to evaluate the changes in chemical mediators, including glutamate + glutamine (Glx), in the brain by using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).The subjects were 17 patients with schizophrenia and 22 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. L-theanine (250 mg/day) was added to the pat
ients' ongoing antipsychotic treatment for 8 weeks. The outcome measures were the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores and MRS results.There were significant improvements in the PANSS positive scale and sleep quality after the L-theanine treatment. As for MRS, we found no significant differences in Glx levels before and after the 8 week L-theanine treatment. However, significant correlations were observed between baseline density of Glx and change in Glx density by l-theanine.Our results suggest that L-theanine is effective in ameliorating positive symptoms and sleep quality in schizophrenia. The MRS findings suggest that L-theanine stabilises the glutamatergic concentration in the brain, which is a possible mechanism underlying the therapeutic effect."
176115955,they will probably put you on a lose dose first if its your first psychotic episode so the side effects wont be too severe
174371541,"Ok guys…I’ve been slaving away at the ketogenic diet for a year. I’ve been refining the diet, researching it, and tweaking it. It is HIGHLY effective at treating my schizophrenia. It removed severe anxiety within a month. It made symptoms much easier to ignore in the second month. I had more energy and could handle symptoms much better. This is with a keto diet used for weight loss. I got on a different keto diet used for the treatment of epilepsy. I am still in the adaptation phase, but WOW! The results have been phenomenal so far. I can ignore voices easily. I have moments when my delusions go away which is a miracle. I’m not ruminating. My focus is outstanding. Im only half way through adaptation and the results have been absurd. There are moments when I can think. My mind is coming back. My verbal IQ is through the roof. I started doing poetry which I haven’t done since I was a kid. My energy is increasing. I could go on for a couple of pages really. I can answer any questions. Check 
out the keto subreddit on Reddit for help getting started. I got in touch with The _NAME_ Foundation for the therapeutic ketogenic diet. I got good results with nutritional keto (keto for weight loss). I’d suggest starting with nutritional keto. Then, setup one appointment per month with the _NAME_ foundation. Disclaimer: for some people, symptoms get worse during the adaptation phase. The adaptation phase can be 6 weeks to 3 months. It does get better. Make sure to work with a health professional though."

If your medical team are arguing about whether you have it or don’t is one thing, but arguing what dose you want is all in your ball park. I don’t trust myself to tell you anything substantive that they shouldn’t have a handle on…although my medical team did tend to forget things. Please keep in mind side effects, stomach problems poo issues, whether or not you’re able to think clearly on your dose, If you’re feeling light headed. whatever is bothering you bring it up.

176115967,Yeah I mean without the sensitivity to the allure… There are a whole lot of things that aren’t all that appealing to notice. It’s kind of like getting to good a look at my own toenails… Like damn those are super yellow. How ?????? long have they been that yellow. I don’t remember having yellow toes. I shower every day… I mean what else is there. I mean I was my feet too… I don’t just let the water run down them. Like that relationship… Except to other people’s body parts. I think that’s why crushes are so powerful… It’s like whatever said person of desire is emitting is basically like a pheromone cocktail of hallucinogens.
176115968,"I called the mental health line just to talk to someone real Their line of questions I followed and answered, as it was refreshing to get it off my chest how I am feeling inside - where nobody is usually allowed to know or would even understand how I feel This person told me I needed to go to an urgent unit for up to 72 hours for extra support She puts me through to a mental health nurse… This person treated me like absolute ????. I honestly cannot bring myself to call them ever again The nurse completely ignored my issues, and we ended up getting into an argument He was saying I was deliberately choosing to mis-understand him. I am an honest person, and I tell the truth of what I hear or see in front of me There is no way in hell I mis-understood this ‘clinician’. He made it absolutely clear to me that he was unprepared to do anything, and this magical thing this other person mentioned about going somewhere to be able to just ‘take a break’, was pure fiction Swear to a god I don’t even 
believe in… The records must have me down as an absolute time waster They expect me to continue popping the pills I am given, yet on the other hand I get this attitude of denial that I have problems that need dealing with It’s eternally frustrating to be treated like this. I have no faith in the support network in front of me that I have to rely on What can I do about this other than take all these pills in one go just to have the final say in my death at a hearing where I’d hope the law would prosecute these people for negligence."

176115970,"Hey there! Thanks for telling your stories. These are longer posts and i have a bit of a “detail filtering problem” (in general, and more so today), so forgive me if i dont respond as you’d like. I dont think you should be ashamed over not having a lot of experience. That is no shame at all. Right now i would actually prefer a man i met to have a bit less experience. From a girl’s perspective it is a little different i think. I have had experience, more than im proud of, but since i got ill it is difficult. Im celibate for now. I always dissociated from my feelings with sex. Now i dont want that anymore, so i would feel frightened to be physical with a guy again. I would feel clumsy and awkward indeed and not know what to do. Last guy i met we just cuddled and kissed a bit, and i felt very shy. It feels like it is the first time im doing physical things as “me” (which might sound odd, dont know how to express). So i actually feel superinexperienced and much more self-conscious than when 
i first started having sex."

176116029,"For me, coping means multiple things, usually divided between physical and psychological. My coping regimen means ‘multitasking’. When I wake up in the morning, I have to get myself ready by laying in bed to minimize fatigue. If I am having a high level of paranoia with any of the physical symptoms, I have to try to manage both physical and mental problems I’m having at that same time. As you have asked what ‘coping’ might seem to a non-mentally ill person, many people in my physical disability community express concern for both psychological and physical state of themselves. Having a physical illness means that you often become disappointed or sad because you’re not yourself anymore. When you lose ability to do a certain activity, such as walking or even eating, it’s hard not to get sad. I guess for a person like me managing both physical and mental illnesses, coping means to remind myself of the beauty and the virtue I have."

176116036,Did u ever get diagnosed with sz I’m scared that my diagnosis of psychosis will turn into sz
176116038,"Lately I drink a bottle of wine in one sitting, let’s say with lunch or with dinner. After having drunk a bottle, it’s as if I have smoked a joint . Wine has calories, weed has not . I prefer weed though. I miss the old days when I was drinking a bottle of frozen vodka every night"
176116039,That is normal. If you have not went through it. It is hard to understand.
176116040,"I find it hard to deal with customers. I used to work in subway and i got paranoid and hid when people came in hahahahahaha. Cleaning would be a do able job. I think i might try at the retirement home, just taking them meals and cleaning up."
176116041,How are you _AT_MENTION_ ? New meds always make me wonder at first. I always think the pdoc just gave me a placebo
176116042,"Honestly you probably could function without an antipsychotic because technically 2.5mg of Abilify has no antipsychotic properties. It’s not even the dose to begin with for depression (5mg) But you may benefit from being on higher doses, I don’t know I’m not a doctor. I don’t have full blown schizophrenia but I need to be on an antipsychotic. Antipsychotic treatments are seen with other psychotic disorders as well. They are not just for schizophrenic patients. I would discuss the issue in depth with a qualified psychiatrist. Good luck _AT_MENTION_"
176116043,"Don’t dump names of other people on the internet OR their actions OR accept labels or label others. Avoid the Internet, especially forums with very defined labels and ideaology that prop them up. I hope you will have your needs met."" _PERSON_’s Heirarchy of Needs"" is better than any pyramid scheme based upon want$."
176116044,Can I ask what stuff you are on medications for? No worries if it is personal. Please don’t do a cold turkey though. It could cause serious damage I think.
176116045,"Her name is _PERSON_, and she seems really nice and understanding! She’s going to sit in on my pdoc appointment on Thursday to help get a better idea of where I’m at. _PERSON_ !!"
176116046,Just be yourself and it’s all good. The best you can do with people is be friendly and yourself. You’ll never be friends with everyone but you just need a few and it’s all good. I think your a pretty cool dude and like your posts. There’s at least one person who thinks your pretty good. You’ll probably surprise yourself!
176116047,That doesn’t seem like a big order. You’ll be fine.
176116048,I want to die too dude but we have to fight. This is a test from god. You cant just give up we have too fight. no body knows if the suffering stops when your dead.
176116049,"I’m not gifted, just an good amateur."
176116050,"No problem, not immediately but slowly during 2-3 weeks."
176116051,Do you think it is the sort of thing that requires more meds or should I just chalk it up to sz and get on with it?
176116052,"Well, it really isn’t funny. People wonder how a teacher’s kid could be so ignorant."
176116053,I kept waiting to hear the rap. Are you going to add a rap to it?
176116054,I’m sorry for u
176116055,"I wonder if it has to do with depression. I once had a psychiatrist tell me to rest because I was healing and I should let others around me pick up the slack. I listened to him, and I’ve been resting ever since, it’s still not helping. I think I’ll go back to doing stuff since I’m going to be tired anyway, might as well get stuff done if I can. I’ll just do a little at a time, the best I can. At least that way I won’t feel as guilty about being “dead weight”"
174371567,"I mean,I don’t plan to take psych meds but have a history of schizophrenia,psychosis.I took meds for many years,but due to personal choice,not planning to take it any sooner.Is it ok to post,or should I leave and go somewhere else?"
176116056,I’m just glad I’m not such a coward any more… nor am I as quick to get carried away with some daydream I’ve become dependent on. lol… I just normally try to get them talking and just listen… I figure them out quicker that way… everyone appreciates a patient ear. I mean I do chime in… It takes time before my brains starts working properly… in regards to this current endeavor… I’ll at least find more long term comfort in just seeing myself around those sort of upper class girls… also get to deal with that come and go jealousy stuff… the irrational fears… really just get to watch my own patterns for a while. Get familiar witha more grown up version of myself… cause I haven’t had a girl like this on my mind for a few years. (The last time it did go horribly wrong lol… that girl was a self-proclaimed stray cat though… no respect at all for even the simplest things.)
176116057,I truly hadn’t noticed!
176116058,Oh okay I’m sorry you got such bad side effects. The only other one I can think of would be Lamictal which isn’t actually for mood stability it’s actually an anti-convulsant I’m sure you already know of this one but just throwing it out there.
176116059,"He was a nobber! It’s the kind of opinion that you should keep to yourself, although my mother in law didn’t the last time I saw her. I just saw my CPN and she’s getting me in to see my pdoc as soon as he’s back off holiday. Meanwhile I’m going to just carry on taking my meds, or fat pills as I call them!"
176116060,Hi _PERSON_! I missed you
176116061,"Wishing you well, llama bud. Hang in there"
174371574,I get it sooo so bad. It must be the clozapine. Anyone else get this ?
174371569,"Invega sustenna 234 mg Abilify pills 10mg Invega makes me blah. No motivation. No sexual desire. Miss periods. Abilify gets rid pf those, but makes me hungry and I’ve noticed twitching muscles."
176116062,Alot of nothing or things that don’t make sense.
176116063,_AT_MENTION_ This is such a good thing to hear! Keep doing it!
176116064,"Thank you for correcting my math it is not the best haha! _AT_MENTION_ I have pursued many different strange avenues due to my delusional beliefs. Priests, healers, etc. Do you know what the only thing was that made what I was experiencing stop and hugely improve? Antipsychotics. I think that speaks worlds. I know it feels wrong to reject your delusional beliefs because they are rooted in such powerful emotions. Again that is where thinking with your mind and not your gut comes into play. It is difficult to do at first but it is a skill that improves with practice. With the right medication (medication i find lessens those intense feelings that make us “certain” our beliefs are true) and that skill developed you will find the truth and be able to avoid getting sucked into these delusions in the future. It is also very common to just not want to be mentally ill due to _USER_ID_, and people don’t want to feel like they are “crazy”. But there are many of us here who will understand and are h
ere to give support and guidance if needed. You are not alone. I wish you the best!!"
176116065,I’m currently part of my family so by association a member of society. But I don’t work and I hardly ever see friends.
176116066,Sorry but i would wash your hands of your Daughter and let her get on with it. Shes clearly giving you no respect anyway. Just patiently wait for when she realises what a mess shes made and forgive her when she comes crawling back. Let her learn by her own mistakes.
176116067,Who punched you and why?
176116068,"I talked to my Psychiatric care nurse and she seemed to think that it would probably be a risk for a kick up for my akathisia and because it stays in your system longer, it would be pretty harsh if you had that problem."
176116069,"I am too ashamed to admit how much I weigh, but I almost doubled my weight in 18 months. I think that’s when my depression started. It got really bad last December/January. But now I am trying really hard to eat better. I won’t know how I’m doing until my next pdoc appointment on Feb. 25th. I’m hoping to have at least maintained my weight, but I’d really like to see that I’ve lost 5 lbs."
176116070,"When you go on a first date at a restaurant, check and see how your partner treats the wait staff…because that is an indicator of how you will be treated down the road in your relationship."
176116071,Welcome back. Hope you decide to stick around
176116072,I use a pillbox and set my phone alarms and log in the times into my phone.
176116073,"I thought one day I was having heart problem,but find out because I was nicotine sick from a mistake he vaping.Its a tough week but I got through it and now I am fine from physical illnesses."
176116074,"When I was initially put on an antidepresent it helped, but after many years I realized I no longer needed it and it had caused me to pack on the pounds. When I was late with a dose I got brain zaps and body zaps. When I quit cold turkey I spent about 3 months going through withdrawal hell, but it was worth it, I am not depressed after qutting and I lost about 30lbs after quitting. I am much healthier now. I don’t think the antidepresent cured my depression, it just masked it until I started thinking better which made me feel better. I got over the trauma that caused my depression. I had an antipsychotic stop working after over a decade of using it. I would guess the same thing can happen with antidepressents, they all mess with your brain chemistry in different ways."
174371578,"Get my Abilify shot. Take out bag of trash from my living space. Go through papers, throw away what can be thrown away."
174371576,Maybe you were just eclectic Nothing wrong with that
176116075,"I think it comes down to how they’re sensed. With imagination, it’s a picture I can control in my head, that is seen through the minds eye. Not solid and fully formed a picture inside my mind With closed eye hallucination I see it through my real eyes. Outside your head but inside your closed eye field of vision. Like a picture overlapping inside the darkness. That I can’t control."
176116076,I think he means when you are not using it.
176116077,"I would say either age 32 when I was a telemetry and ICU nurse, or today at age 60 when I’m even more successful than I was then. Today, I live in my wife’s beautiful home, we always have plenty of home cooked meals to eat, my wife is my chauffeur, I’m responsible for keeping the house clean, my wife is the repair person and keeps up the yard, and does the laundry."
176116078,"Either way, you shouldn’t have to just live with the shaking."
176116079,It’s definitely happening to me. I can’t say one way or another if it’s happening to you.
176116080,Yeah I have serious depression as well. For me the positives aren’t as bad as depression. I get it real bad but after a lot of trial and error found effexor is the only med to work for me. Happy about that.
176116081,I don’t take responsibility for my actions and feelings and thoughts and that’s why I feel like I’m in a video game with someone else playing me
176116082,I don’t view my illness as good or bad. It was just the card I was dealt.
176116083,"I think you are very delusional and fantastical. I am mildly delusional about being God, and about reptilians. But I have insight."
176116084,Exercise is the key to a lot of our problems in my book. I simply added weight bearing exercise and moved from sleeping 10 hours a day to around 8. I don’t work so sometimes I’ll have a half hour nap but honestly. I’m so much better ahead of the game with exercise and taking the meds as prescribed… It is the single best thing you can do for your health mentally or physically that costs you nothing but your exertion. You can’t lose…
176116085,_AT_MENTION_ Wow! Late night! _PERSON_ sorry! That’s really hard!
174371585,I just ordered Sarcosine from the ProFrontal online store. Will let you all know how it works.
176116086,Maybe you can just do it as a hobby?
176116087,"Oh, moving. The provincial government is closing down my wife’s employer at the end of the school year. There’s a lot of demand for teachers with online teaching experience right now so my wife interviewed for a job and got it within five days. It’s actually a better job in a community with more amenities and better shopping. The higher rent will be offset by cheaper groceries. Here’s a news story about what’s happening: CBC _NAME_ Distance Learning Centre chooses to close a year early over budget... _NAME_ Distance Learning Centre will be defunded and end its programming at the end of this school year. ADLC serves a lot of kids that other schools prefer to offload because they tend not to complete courses and affect the completion rates of the local board. That’s why ADLC gets dinged on completion rates, a much higher percentage of their students are at risk or special needs. The provincial government isn’t taking that into account. This is just a bad decision that’s going to hurt 
a lot of disadvantaged kids. Not much we can do at this point but shrug and keep going as resignations are turned in and new contracts and lease agreements signed.’ The saving grace for us is that we held off on buying a new home last summer. Something felt off to both of us and we didn’t want to get locked into a property even with my wife just having gotten a continuing contract. The provincial government was acting so hostile to ADLC that we just knew something was up. We were right. Several of our friends are now faced with unloading homes they’ve owned for less than a year at a loss. Very horrible. My own job is work from home and portable. My superiors have already cleared the move and authorized my continuing to work from home. My company has a nice branch in my new town, but I’m not expected to work in it. If you want to see where, we’re moving from Barrhead, _NAME_, Canada to Strathmore, _NAME_, Canada."
176116088,I was on Imipramine years ago and it made me manic as hell! I can’t tolerate antidepressants.
174371577,"I’ve heard of Playstation. My son had that. He had them all. I use a yoga app called TrackYoga.com The more classes you take with this app, the more free classes you get. I take so many classes that I never pay for a class."
176116089,For secret santa at work they bought me 1.6 kilos of skittles. I didn’t know they even made bags that big!
176116090,I’m not in debt. One of the plus sides of not working is not being suitable for getting a loan. I have a couple of k in my account.
176116091,Thank you so much for that encouragement I needed that _AT_MENTION_ He sort of does that and seems aggravated when I tell him I have symptoms. That’s when he said he was doing a dna test to see what would work best. I just get so damn aggravated adding and subtracting my meds I feel like a lab monkey
176116092,"Guys, I know what is going on. Thinking is part of problems and solutions. This is going on and partly this is the reason why you guys have difference of opinions. Thanks. ================= Note: To Moderators… _AT_MENTION_ _AT_MENTION_ Sorry to disturb you. I kindly request you to change my tagline to [ Thinking is part of problems and solutions. ] This is my last tagline change. Rest of my life I will stick with this tagline. Thanks."
176116093,"_AT_MENTION_ If you are indeed the leading character in this worldwide movie, then how come you aren’t getting paid…and why aren’t the _PERSON_ banging down your front door? I’ll tell you why. It’s because none of it is happening. You have an affliction/ illness which leads you to believe all of this nonsense. I had the _NAME_ Show delusion as well. I’ve been there…done that…got the t-shirt to prove it."
176116094,_AT_MENTION_ How are you now? _AT_MENTION_ Same question. How are you now?
176116095,I started school a few weeks ago and my wife started working and now I’m so depressed. I can barely get out of bed. My schoolwork is all online so I don’t have contact with anyone during the day. I’m taking my meds and they help sometimes but I just can’t seem to get over this. I just feel alone.
176116096,How did you get passed this?
176116097,"I just keep my head down and take everything a day, an hour at a time. I have more on my plate now but I seem to handle it alright in smaller increments the way I organize it mentally in my head."
176116098,"Oh, that’s sweet."
176116099,There’s often a seasonal component to mood disorders like bipolar disorder or depression. I am sza bipolar type so i deal with that and spring is usually a time of depression for me. I tend to feel better in autumn. I don’t know why. I think that’s kind of backwards from the typical situation.
176116100,Haha I don’t like future much. Too much auto tune !! . He’s alright but there’s a lot of rappers I like better. He just made a song with _NAME_ and post _PERSON_. Blowing up now like posts whole album . Meek mill is cool. _PERSON_ and _NAME_. Some of my favorites
176116101,In nba live 08 I was ranked top 15 in the world. I actually figured out such a good strategy I was something like 250-20 record on my first account until I made a new account Went 70-0 until a game exited on me and gave me the loss even though I was up by 30 points. Then I quit playing soon after that because I was pissed That was on ps3 I think
176116102,"If you took loxapine, what was your experience with it?"
176116103,_AT_MENTION_ Why though. If their natural with less side effects? I guess there’s no money to make off them.
176116104,Kinda sorta. Old in some ways where people my age are still young. Young and naive in some ways where people my age are old/of the right age.
176116105,"I didn’t make it through the first day, my blood sugar went to high. I felt weird."
176116106,I’ll try it out at some point.
176116107,"Sorta same thing happened to me, _AT_MENTION_ . There was a girl, (woman) in my life (I’m a female), for over 15 years and I kidded myself into thinking she loved me. (She didn’t). Anyway, she’s out of my life now and I’m unsure of what to do. Look for another relationship with another woman or forget about romantic relationships altogether and be a celibate for God?"
176116108,"I would adscribe to the “universe as a process” view of the universe, it´s much more anxiety free. Picture it as music, as a symphony. There is no rush because there´s no end goal. The goal should be enjoying the process itself. I would see the existence of people as symptomatic of the type of universe we live in. As an apple tree grows apples, this universe grows people. If you are in anxiety, is because you are looking for an end goal, a time restricted task. BTW. The universe is not unintelligent, because we “grow” out of it and we are intelligent. This universe is intelligent."
176116109,"I was met by 6 out of province psychiatrists that flew in to my small little city during my initial psychosis. Around 3 in the morning they showed up and pretended to help me. Eventually the “students” they bought along stalked me all over the place in the city for 1 year. I made predictions about the pandemic and plenty of other things on a conspiracy website. I made controversial opinions and that was when i got watched. Sure, you can deny it if you want that there isnt some police on the internet watching every forum and site for dissidents or something idk. What im telling you is the truth, there is something going on in this world that cant be explained unless you are in the actual group. You can call me delusional if you want and tell me to take my meds but i know what i happened."
176116110,I faked all of my hallucinations here and most of the delusions except for one I agree its a horrible subreddit but explain what am I then if not a faker

You’d think she’d want to spend as much time with you as the insurance allows. Also, I think you handled it well and I’m proud of you for actually asking her."

176116133,"I have a travel sized colouring book and a case with markers in it. It’s helpful for me to focus on colouring instead of whatever is stressing me. If you’re into crafts, studies have shown knitting activates some of the same rewards in the brain as meditation does. Scarves and hats can get too repetitive, but I like knitting socks. They’re not too hard to learn, and they don’t take forever. Once you’ve got the basic recipe learnt you can experiment with variations in pattern and style. It helps me divert focus from unwanted things without overloading my brain, and it keeps me from having restless hands."
176116134,It’s the first time she has discussed it with me yes. But I don’t think it’s purely cause I’m with someone who has aspergers. My sz is very stable now. But I have a lot of social problems and also problems being intimate which we discussed yesterday.

176116139,"As you know I have the same concern about dying. Someone here once said ill deal with that wen I cross that bridge. But it’s just thinking of the proportions in time and afterlife significance for that reason that makes it therefore still loom in my mind. Afterlife is possibly for eternity. This life is only 90 years. So it just looms over me. I think I need to develop a faith in a good after life. It might be my only option. The blocking it out method doesn’t work for me that’s the thing. So I think that if I attract a good afterlife faith into my mind and BELIEVE that I am a worthy person of that, ie a good person so act in accordance, then that is wat my mental energy will attract wen I die. Law of attraction might have a scientific basis too I need to look into that. I’m not saying I will go to church and stuff cos that is attached with too many goods and bads rules which will only confuse me. And frighten me. And overwhelm me. ND All that history is too much to take in too But just to 
develop my own personal faith in a good afterlife by some way. Perhaps regular meditation and visualisation on ’ heaven. ’ And living a full life so that my mind doesn’t have the time to think about this idea of 'hell. 'since that was just the disease speaking. Not wat is actually going to happen."

174371593,"My first diagnosis was made when I was 20, I wasn’t hospitalized immediately and because of some used or know that schizophrenics are leaning towards experiment or abusing some drugs. As me who grew up in very conservative family, my mother’s father was huge alcoholic, my mother was really against any use of drugs, even nicotine. So when I started studying in UK the first night I tried weed with my new friend’s and I didn’t feel much, but liked the vibe of gave to my flatmates(New friends). So this the journey slowly began of wake and bake, smoking blunts and then deing bongs. I also at the same time to sustain myself I started working at fast food chain for long hours, so to relieve stress I always took a bong shot when I came back to unwind, just to have some laugh with my friends. Also at university I tried LSD 3 times in 2 years and Mdma also 3 times ( I think). With LSD I had one really good trip, then alright one, and then a really bad one that did mix up with my upcoming psychosis of 
schizophrenia. Actually the second year of University when I was psychotic, I took long breaks between smoke ups, like a month or two for one session. Then a lot of drama happened between my friends and me that resulted in me being moved to a separate University’s flat. I wasn’t hospitalized and no one offered me one, instead I was constantly interviewed by medical staff and kept on asking what I “used”. As being half manic and psychotic I was eager to tell them everything and hence to say that they are often ignorant and pretended not to know how “wild” students really are nowadays, they diagnosed me with Drug Induced Psychosis, that I felt neither good or bad. The funny past is they gave me 25mg quetiapine to take at night for the treatment and then later changed to 1mg of risperidone daily until I came back to my home country. I was hospitalized here in Lithuania and they changed my diagnosis to Paranoid Schizophrenia but my mom somehow believed the initial diagnosis and refused me to bring me 
for disability evaluation and my psydoc refused to get paper for assessment as I have to look healthy to come back to university. So when I just left the hospital after mg initial psychosis, I suffered massive negatives as my positives weren’t that developed (especially hallucinations and voices). My mom were constantly shouting at me for smoking, I was afraid to have one beer to relax after work( even I couldn’t feel any buzz at first). She forced me to get employed at Musuem’s Park that the job was really difficult: digging pitches 1.5 meters deep to plant some trees in a bricky soil. I wanted to smoke a lot, my mother wasn’t buying any cigarettes or cheap tobacco, I often ended up begging my co-workers who were also sent from job centre for community service. Believe me or not, but I couldn’t imagine what was happening with me, I was often the last one to dig up the pitch, while scuny alcoholic 60 year old was taking lead against me. My head was empty and what I was thinking that if j could just 
sit down for a while and have a smoke and try to think about something. ALL the money I earning my mother took for herself to pay the expenses I cost for bringing back from UK. The relapse I had a year ago, proved that I didn’t use any drugs and I relapse because I stopped medication. My mom changed completely how she talks with me and we went on to claim disability. Now after I relapsed she was first to say relax and don’t initiate even a job search until you fully feel like you could hold a low end job. It’s not enough to carry a Schizophrenia label but it’s harder to carry “drug addicted that went bet crazy” label."

174371597,"I can tell you that in the possible future conspiracy theorists will be possibly targeted from the future and given schizophrenia in the past to disable them and incapacitate them. They will be pre identified before they get famous or rich. I think this happened to me. I know about it because I heard about it before in a parallel universe… If you study the illuminati, you will realize schizophrenia could be used against certain people. I think Zika virus was man made and sent to the past…why not schizophrenia too?"

My only concern is, are my problems serious enough to talk to a psychotherapist? All I know is things really started to go bad for me in grade 6 when I hardly ever got my homework done. That was a little more than 31 years ago, but I think it sent me off on a really bad trajectory. Just putting it out there."

174371599,"I guess I have Aspergers and schizophrenia does the opposite. I blamed the meds a lot but they are supposed to help me. I don’t think Aspergers plus a stimulant would be good. I thought I had auditory processing disorder for a while. Maybe ADD too. My sister says I don’t have ADD at all. She said because I can focus for hours like when I played video games. I played video games literally all day as a kid. I just cannot focus like I used to. I have no motivation and I’m a lot dumber than I used to be, but I’m more open minded to a fault."

176116167,yeah iam always thinking about the illuminati to my voices say that they are them and want to torture me
176116168,I see That makes sense
176116169,Okay. Two points I want to make. First of all - all entertainment is a waste of money if they dont bring you pleasure. But if they do bring you pleasure then they arent a waste of money. Video games being fairly new always have a bad rep - but its no different from spending money watching a football team etc. I don’t feel like they are more of a waste of time or money than anything else - as long as you enjoy them. Second of all. Resident Evil has never been an easy game. Its supposed to be punishing. I haven’t played much of it but when I have its always kicked my arse. Thats kind of part of “the charm”. My only advice to you is to keep trying. If you keep losing you can always try an easier difficulty to learn the game’s layout and mechanics and maybe help ease out the learning experience.

I’ve personally found that taking cold showers helps me feel good and also doing an online course each day adds structure to my day. If I can’t complete a section or an assignment I simply move onto a different course. I’ve been living in the countryside for the past 7 months and it’s made me feel more relaxed. I can go on walks when I want and also do chores around the house. Today I learnt about how to boil rice for one person. I’ve also found that by improving my view of women, not merely viewing them as sexual objects, I have found more happiness. I was never sexist, but I valued pleasure over meaningful relationships. I think one of my daughters was put up for adoption, because there was no way I could have looked after her. My dad told me when he was complaining about it. I suppose there is now the argument I have something

176116235,"Very happy with the last appointment. While she insists -as expected- in keeping the sz diagnosis she freely admitted that I seemed happier since quitting APs, and more importantly in her view, fairly functional. So far I’ve been able to fully compartmentalise my “unusual” and “normal” self which become activated in turn depending on the context. Previous doctors and psychologists had already remarked on my double book-keeping which in my case seems to be the norm. I have been more ongoing, spending more time with friends, and generally enjoying things more. My anhedonia seems gone. On the downside my apathy and lack of motivation remain strong, but I’ve been successful in not ruminating over my unusual beliefs by distracting myself by playing chess online. My psych would have preferred that I returned to the narrow medicalised path, but she also made it plain that she supported my choices and would continue to have my back. There were some light moments too. At one point she asked me w
hy did I bother answering her questions when I believed she was merely a projection of myself, to which I replied “I enjoy talking to myself”. To avoid misunderstandings, I would like to make clear that I’ve never been completely against medication. What I have criticised and will continue to criticise is the overreliance on meds at the expense of addressing the social and existential dimensions of sz. Perhaps the only dark of the meeting note had to do with vraylar/realiga. A year on since I stopped taking it I still get some twitches and muscle spasms at night. She expressed concern and stated that she couldn’t rule out some degree of neurological damage. So much for miracle drugs. But I have chosen to remain optimistic."

174371617,Yes. I don’t get voices but I have this central thought that comments on everything I do. I also have thoughts that enter my head and impossible to remove. I do better these days but it’s the same realm. Stress is my biggest problem still though. I don’t often notice things going wrong till stressed.

174371626,"Side Effects & Safety When taken by mouth : Fish oil is LIKELY SAFE for most people when taken by mouth in low doses (3 grams or less per day). There are some safety concerns when fish oil is taken in high doses. Taking more than 3 grams per day might keep blood from clotting and can increase the chance of bleeding. ADVERTISEMENT High doses of fish oil might also reduce the immune system’s activity, reducing the body’s ability to fight infection. This is a special concern for people taking medications to reduce their immune system’s activity (organ transplant patients, for example) and the elderly. Only take high doses of fish oil while under medical supervision. Fish oil can cause side effects including belching, bad breath, heartburn, nausea, loose stools, rash, and nosebleeds. Taking fish oil supplements with meals or freezing them can often decrease these side effects. Consuming large amounts of fish oil from some DIETARY sources is POSSIBLY UNSAFE . Some fish meats (especially shark, kin
g mackerel, and farm-raised salmon) can be contaminated with mercury and other industrial and environmental chemicals. Fish oil supplements typically do not contain these contaminants. When given by IV : Fish oil is POSSIBLY SAFE when injected intravenously (by IV) in the short-term. Fish oil or omega-3 fatty acid solutions have been safely used for 1 to 4 weeks. Special Precautions & Warnings: Children : Fish oil is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately. Fish oil has been used safely through feeding tubes in infants for up to 9 months. But young children should not eat more than two ounces of fish per week. Fish oil is also POSSIBLY SAFE when given in the vein by a health care professional to infants who cannot take food by mouth. Fish oil is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when consumed from dietary sources in large amounts. Fatty fish contain toxins such as mercury. Eating contaminated fish frequently can cause brain damage, mental retardation, blindness and seizures in children. Pregnancy and breast-feeding : F
ish oil is LIKELY SAFE when taken by mouth appropriately. Taking fish oil during pregnancy does not seem to affect the fetus or baby while breast-feeding. Women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant, and nursing mothers should avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish (also called golden bass or golden snapper), as these may contain high levels of mercury. Limit consumption of other fish to 12 ounces/week (about 3 to 4 servings/week). Fish oil is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when dietary sources are consumed in large amounts. Fatty fish contain toxins such as mercury. Bipolar disorder : Taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition. Liver disease : Fish oil might increase the risk of bleeding in people with liver scarring due to liver disease. Depression : Taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition. Diabetes : There is some concern that taking high doses of fish oil might make the control of blood sugar more difficult. Familial adenomatous polyposis : Ther
e is some concern that fish oil might further increase the risk of getting cancer in people with this condition. High blood pressure : Fish oil can lower blood pressure and might cause blood pressure to drop too low in people who are being treated with blood pressure-lowering medications. HIV/AIDS and other conditions in which the immune system response is lowered : Higher doses of fish oil can lower the body’s immune system response. This could be a problem for people whose immune system is already weak. An implanted defibrillator (a surgically placed device to prevent irregular heartbeat) : Some, but not all, research suggests that fish oil might increase the risk of irregular heartbeat in patients with an implanted defibrillator. Stay on the safe side by avoiding fish oil supplements. Fish or seafood allergy : Some people who are allergic to seafood such as fish might also be allergic to fish oil supplements. There is no reliable information showing how likely people with seafood allergy are to have an a
llergic reaction to fish oil. Until more is known, advise patients allergic to seafood to avoid or use fish oil supplements cautiously."
176116262,"I actually heard many places and seen _NAME_ say it in interviews himself that “Yesterday” came to him in a dream. He dreamed about a catchy little tune and when he woke up he was kind of thinking that it was not an original tune. He thought maybe he heard it somewhere else so he called all the other _PERSON_ and sang a little of the tune and played a little on his guitar and asked them if they ever heard it before. They all said “no” and so he fooled around with it and developed the chords and came up with some lyrics. Originally he didn’t have a title for it so he called it “Scrambled Eggs.” Eventually he worked out all the music and lyrics and it became one of the most popular _PERSON_ song ever though it’s really a solo _NAME_ song. It’s one of the most covered songs in pop music history. I never heard that about Yellow Submarine. All I heard about the creation of Yellow Submarine is that when _NAME_ and _NAME_ wrote it, _PERSON_ pictured it as a kids song and he envisioned sc
hoolkids all over England running around playing and singing it. It’s not a particularly complicated song to sing, that’s why they gave it to _PERSON_ to sing, lol."
176116263,_AT_MENTION_ This sounds exactly the same for me. Some days it’s more pressing than others. I also thought others weren’t real. I also thought I was dead.

Last time I went off meds for a few months, I was just listening to my thoughts mostly and doing nothing and just drinking the drinks. A lot of my thoughts are schizophrenia spectrum type stuff. I tend to think they are my past lives or in parallel universes. I dunno, I believe them sometimes. I think I have improved over the years, but don’t really want to work or go to school out of fear and because I’m afraid of trying and afraid of failure.

176116282,"I worked at Sears in the mid-nineties; mainly unloading trucks, putting away the merchandise and organizing the stock in our warehouse. After I had been there about two months something “clicked” one day and I just started working harder and soon I became one of the fastest, hardest, best workers there. There was only one other guy there who was as good as me. I worked so hard that almost every week I got at least one positive comment about how good a worker I was. In fact not only did my supervisor give me compliments on my work but a lot of the sales people and loss prevention guys did too. My co-workers were always telling me to slow down and not work so hard. Anyways, I was about the best worker for almost two years and I even won a worker of the month award and got my picture put up over the time clock so every employee could see it when they punched in and out for work. I was in my mid-thirties by the way, outworking all my co-workers who were mainly teenagers or in their early twenties."

176116307,"You’re welcome. Soteria House was very controversial and it had a lot of critics. It had a lot of people in the psychiatric field who were opposed to it and said it didn’t work. But the founders claimed it was a success. There used to be several of them around the world and I believe there are a couple of them still going in a couple different countries. The one I was in closed in around 1984 for lack of funds, Both sides of the argument can drag out statistics supporting their claims. You’re right, it must have helped some people or it wouldn’t have been in existence as long as it was. I saw a lot of people there who were in a lot of mental pain. I saw suffering but it had its positive good points. I wouldn’t really call it a program as it had few rules and no official therapy going on and everybody stayed at different lengths of time. They purposely staffed it with people who had no training but were hired for being open minded, friendly, patient empathetic, willing to listen at any tim
e and let people go through their psychosis without being judgmental or intolerant. They didn’t try to talk people out of delusions but just were there for them and be with them as they went through it. It was very informal and most days everybody hung out in the kitchen talking. The staff just tried to be friends with everyone. But there were no real guidelines as in other programs. They called this approach, “normalizing the schizophrenic experience”. People just said what they want and talked out their episodes."

He was so good at his position and set so many records that he will be remembered more and longer than a lot of obscure and average quarterbacks. I don’t know the names of a lot of current football players but I do know that when the 49’rs were winning those Super Bowls in the eighties players like cornerback _NAME_, wide receiver _NAME_, or running back _NAME_ were well known. I mean quarterback _NAME_ will be long forgotten when people are still talking about _NAME_ Rice’s feats on the field. In their day, running backs like _NAME_ or _NAME_ or _NAME_ were bigger stars than many quarterbacks and were inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame while many quarterbacks weren’t.

176116366,Last month i was having some psychosis or grandeur i was sober. My gf said i went from talking about that i had a good sized weener and that i didnt wanna have elon musks babies… I dont even remember saying it or why lol. I couldnt talk like that if i was drunk. All i know is elon musk is a tesla car maker
176116367,"Glad to hear you’re doing good, it’s amazing what people can overcome"
176116368,"I dont really write it down,maybe due to paranoia somebody will find it"
176116369,Trying it out isnt the end of the world though. You can always switch to another AP if it doesnt work for you.
176116370,? feel terrible when i wake up.i feel that something permanently loss at my body.or something bad will happen about my health.
176116371,My tendency is toward all or nothing. It’s a problematic mindset to say the least.
174371655,What were your intrusive thoughts like b4 vraylar?
174371649,"I got the real story from 2 people who have installed schizophrenia, and from the police department. Not all visions are real, however… real life does have instances where idiots tap into someone’s mind, and cause thousands of criticisms on purpose. That is the official message of the police. It can be all fake, but that isn’t always the case. People can open a “witnessing window” in your mind, usually at a location where you were with them in the past. Years later, you can see visions that they have caused from that place. The second location is also visible from the visions. (One of mine is a classroom with desks.) It’s a visual message relay system, and it really sucks that it’s used for stupid, immoral purposes. That’s what I have learned."
176116372,Hi all so I’m just wondering how many of you get faint voices like me. Thanks to medication I get them sometimes when I’m stressed and they are incredibly hard to hear. So do you get faint voices that are hard to hear and almost inaudible?

176116375,"Day, sorry for the “banality” I would like to know addressed particularly above all to those who are underage but in puberty or young adults if the risperdal affects the size of the penis, already here we have talked about it a few times but none has been exhaustive. I would like to know your experience both positive and negative, I thank in advance those who will kindly reply and greetings."
174371652,"I think it comes down to positive symptoms more likely to disturb _NAME_ and _NAME_ public while negative ones mostly affect the person with SMI . Certainly in the UK when the acute and positive symptoms are not prominent you get put to the bottom of the pile re help and support . If you’re coping to any degree at all, then that’s seen as good enough ."
176116376,What is the book about?
176116377,I have a feeling the eyelid tremors will go away in time I used to get those I’m on invega which is basically risperdal
176116378,When i came back home on aps ( couldnt come home untreated) I just sat around playing ps4 but my dad made me go on an hour long walk with him each day.
176116379,work has helped me a lot. I would be far worse without work. I am busy and have routine. I talk with people and use my brain to think.
176116380,I have no money at all.
176116381,"I agree.But is rare now.It takes time to get used to it,but when you hooked on freedom that’s it."
176116382,Your right I should do something find or watch something fun. I have _PERSON_ and yeah I do watch _NAME_ and _PERSON_. Just lately nothing makes me smile. I can’t help it but be in the dark.
176116383,yes peru! im also interested in the missippian culture along the rivers. had a chance to visit emerald mound in mississippi this past january.
176116384,"And its not like if antipsychotics gets you high or something. Maybe fake pain to get narcotics but not psychosis, its impossible."
176116385,"That’s okay, I just thought you were the one doing this to me for a second"
176116386,A timely death is a joyous thing.
176116387,Aw ok. Hopefully things will improve for me.
176116388,I’m on 117 mg Invega Sustenna plus 1.5 daily pills. It has cleared up the psychosis but I have mouth quivering and anxiety because of it.

176116390,"I’d say average. I am no longer consumed by negative self talk, I thank CBT for that."
176116391,about 8 - 9 years in and i aint givin up. gotta keep trying
176116392,It is not like a desert either. The humidity gets pretty high in countries like France. It is actually pretty dangerous.
176116393,I’m sorry Mama 15
176116394,Yes i got diagnosis doctor said herniated disc its not serious case
174371653,Yes. ? used xyprexa.i used to sleep ages when i m on it.so its really strange to not put on sleep to you.weird. Maybe it s not effective enough at you as supposed to be. ? lived only close feelings and fears close to your fears when i m on abilify. So it s better to examine that medicine. That medicine cause very similar feelings and fears at people.
176116395,"Of course it ain’t real, that’s the definition of a delusion."
174371651,What I know is that I had symptoms from the age of 8.
176116396,I’m really happy for you. You seem like a nice man and I’m glad you found someone nice.
176116397,I saw it and I thought it was good
176116398,"If everything you are saying is valid, (and I don’t doubt you) I would go above this psychiatrist’s head and file a complaint with the brass that run the show. I’m sure the powers that be would also like to know if they have a bad apple on their team. And definitely find a new psychiatrist! Good luck!"
174371656,Thanks that makes sense. Do you?e schizophrenic symptoms have a different theme to your PTSD? Like are the hallucinations and delusions unrelated or do they have same theme as PTSD?
176116399,"I knew I probably had sz for the first time when I took the city bus with my boyfriend. My bf told me to stop the bus. I instantly went into shock mode because I realized I didn’t know how to get the bus to stop. I just froze and felt every eye on me. I was afraid to move. Luckily, my bf stopped the bus for me."
176116400,"I used to be a racist and very strongly conservative. Gun toting and all. Yes, I had a big truck with a gun rack, lol and had a lot of confederate flag items and clothes. Pills didn’t change that, education and exposure to different types of people did. With the early internet there were less polarizing extremist groups and it was easier to become educated about different people and cultures than offline. I didn’t live in a diverse area."
176116401,Have a Bath - Im starting to stink. Put a load of washing on. Change the Bed after bath. Go thru my Video Games - Im starting to run out of disk space.
176116402,"I eat a fair bit of junk food but am weight stable. The biggest problem is my arthritis after eating something like a few burgers. If I were on a higher AP dose I’d gain weight like crazy though. Also the intermittent fasting thing helps probably, but I keep eating lunch here and there. Anyhow, 200 lbs is ok. Not super slim or hot but that’s not stopping me from working. I hated managing my diet on a high AP dose. Had to be so stringent, and I’d still be net positive in my weight."
176116403,I hope the Zyprexa works out for you.
176116404,"Since starting Loxapine, I’ve been sleeping 12 hours a day too. It’s frustrating because I want to be up more. But I’m just too tired."
176116405,"In seriousness it would be a shame to kill it, it’s a beautiful specimen. I’d probably trap it and get it to more of an appropriate area. I grew up surrounded by insects, grandfather has a few degrees dealing with all kinds of creepy crawlers."
176116406,"I’ve never really gotten that much from him. I see him monthly and we don’t talk at all. I feel like he wouldn’t be able to tell if I was psychotic because he doesn’t even look up from his computer. I dunno but there is one other doctor where I live that accepts my insurance, and I may go to them because they seem more holistic"
176116407,That is exactly what I’m experiencing
176116408,I told the guy my work had to approve it and has 10 days to answer me and he canceled my drug test and said let him know when it’s approved. He wanted me to start this week.

176116410,"I get annoyed when I go to a website for the first time and get a pop-up solicitation for their newsletter when I haven’t even had a chance to look at the site’s content. Or if it’s a retailer and I get that pop-up asking me to provide my email if I want to save 15% when I don’t even know what they’re selling. I think what makes it worse for me is the slight delay after the website loads so that I just start looking at something before it pops up. I have concentration issues so this really bothers me. I also hate that when I purchase anything from anyone, even just once, I am added to their email list."

174371659,"I’m mean I only tried one brand of curcumin supplements and didn’t think much of it. Where as I like the whole root with black pepper more, it’s more effective."
176116418,It is called body scan where you meditate on what you feel in all different parts of your body. I think it’s really good. Like a way to become more aware of your being _PERSON_. I went to a mindfulness course once. The other thing I like to do in terms of mindfulness (I think it’s similar to meditation) Is I like to take myself out of my body. Observe myself how I’m feeling and it helps me to realise That something about how I’m thinking is not OK eg too stressed so I tell myself something like Relax girl. Or look at you is someone really doing telepathy on you? N then it becomes a bit clearer that no there is only a delusion. I have got to 90 percent belief or maybe even higher that the delusion is just a delusion. But that remaining 10 percent is still like a real feeling.
176116419,I guess it’s just a quick fix for boredom or depression. Doesn’t help in the long run though.
176116420,So what do you do? Does the medicine help you or does it just help you to stay calm? I take meds but I still hear the tv and people around me talking about me.
176116421,You can’t park your car in a no parking zone.
174371661,"Yeah, I didn’t make it that far, dropped out of HS. But I read, read, read. Also I google obsessively. Had to stop using the phone app. Now I just do a few hours a day, and am a tad more productive."
176116422,"I probably haven’t had even 200 mg of caffeine in a day for about 10 days and my slight agitation appears to be gone. I’m taking 1 tablet of Mushroom Wisdom ‘Super’ Lion’s Mane daily. As far as reduction in positives goes, I never seemed to hallucinate, and delusions seem to come and go with stress. For instance: When my mother was dying a couple of months ago, I had a delusion that a bunch of people in line at _NAME_’s were staring at me basically because my first and middle names are Marvel’s Avengers characters, and the next guy gave his name to the cashier as _NAME_. Yes, under stress I was out of it. I helped old _NAME_ get a Coke out of the new fangled Coke machine, and kept functioning at work, but I have to watch the delusions when I’m under stress, I guess. Currently, I don’t believe that I’ve had any delusions about people staring at me in public, or even had anyone staring at me in public, so maybe the Lion’s Mane isn’t making me delusional. So, there’s that."
176116423,"I found that laying on my back with my ears covered up with the water acted like an off switch, maybe this only works if your an actual TI."
176116424,I used to believe I was a God Warrior. That I could defeat the devil with the word of God. It doesn’t say anywhere in the Bible that we are to fight the devil but I was brought up to believe Christians have power over the devil and demons. I thought I was chosen by God to tear down demonic strongholds. Funny thing that. Modern day Christians believe that crap.

This is good in a way, as in my office job I was in constant communication with other people, mainly dealing with stupid questions and trying to ‘firefight’ issues with data etc that idiots created and couldn’t fix themselves. I used to get into a lot of trouble for being blunt in my challenges back to these people. Now I have the other extreme of minimal contact, but I think the benefits of this are much greater as I can get on with my work"

176116446,"Out of curiosity, can you give me some example of “obsolete fields” still taught in universities today? Well, me and others have already hinted that the dichotomy between “theoretical” and “practical” is problematic, unpractical and ultimately false. But it’s ok people having different opinions. Then again maybe we are just not understanding each other so if that’s OK with you I’d like to ask you a couple of questions hinging on the relationship, if any, between the usefulness of a theory -which you believe defines its intrinsic value- and the truth-value of the said theory. Two scenarios: Theory X has been for many years consistently rejected by the scientific establishment. However, new discoveries cast the old theory in a new light and the scientific community comes to accept it as true finding all manner of practical uses for it. The question is: at which point did the theory acquire its intrinsic value, at inception, or later when its truth value was established and practical 
uses found? If the former, how should this affect the way we look at “abstract theories” with no immediate practical use? Theory Y has been the dominant scientific paradigm for decades. However, new discoveries cast the venerable old theory in a new light and its falsehood is exposed. Would such a theory, held as “useful” for so long, have or ever had any intrinsic value? Can a false theory be considered useful if applied? Can a true theory with no practical uses considered to lack value?"

The psychologist diagnosed me with them to argue that I should not be placed on court ordered treatment as what I had was not treatable (one of the requirements of court ordered treatment was that the illness had to be treatable) vs. schizophrenia that is amenable to medication.

176116467,"Im not really pissed anymore, I judged too impulsively. I sometimes do so when something seems to signal i cant trust someone (sensitive spot), someone acts domineering or such.

But i know about the content and had very concrete ideas worked out. I still wouldnt like it if i get money. I like to creatively work out my own ideas. He kind of ran off with it, which i disliked, but was not meant in a bad way. It really wasnt that important in itself, but a few things happened that im sensitive to. I spoke up, he listened.

176116469,"My latest tips: Serve your own mind only (don’t mix up with the others that much of). Don’t be too empathic emotionally and rather a wisdom-based empath. Keep distance to all the triggers. Act normal (even nobody is). Love your mind and everything in you, that is important for you to keep. Don’t drown down because of your symptoms - get up from there! Set a goal out of all the above, i.e. build up a system. PS. Worry later act now and remember to chill out too sometimes."

And also, that’s great that you have no symptoms but if you still need medication are you really fully recovered? In fairness, the definition of a full recovery to most people is fairly ambiguous."

174371676,"I don’t think it’s my genes but the environment stress like outside factors… I guess genes play a role, but I don’t know. I guess everyone is different. I can drink 10 monsters a day every day indefinitely and someone might drink 1 and die from a heart attack. I’m very skeptical now of all schizophrenia research. Like I said, my case is unique. Basically some alien/military/illuminati psy op crap. I guess the end result is the same hence why I am here. I don’t hallucinate or hear voices, but I’ve definitely felt like I had shell-shock or gulf-war syndrome despite never fighting in a war. I guess the common term is PTSD but I don’t really have the symptoms. I sometimes piss the bed and have intense dreams. Feel like I’m talking to people in a car at night frequently… Schizophrenia does not run in my family. We can all find anecdotal evidence or stories, but nobody really knows. I believe it’s the norovirus, and I plan on taking the vaccine. Time will tell again. I just don’t 
know or understand why. I often think it’s myself. Did I create bitcoin, was I _NAME_, or something else? Was it random a fluke? I don’t think so. Some things been going on for eternity. Only I may know the truth. It’s interesting and cool that this new forum member is here and I relate to him. I cannot speak for him as I don’t know his story, but he said he was a former member of a secret society and has schizophrenia. I’ve been having dreams too. I don’t know if it’s fantasy, delusion, or half true half falsehood, or just a past life sort of thing, but I feel like I seen reptilians, might have been one, and even other things. Like vampires and the undead. felt like a god before too. I don’t really relate to most and they don’t relate to me. My delusions are complicated and sophisticated unfortunately and are hard to wrap around. I guess writing books is my future – reality guised as fiction. Like I said, I never wanted this, expected this, or anything. I feel like the military is interwo
ven or deeply connected to secret societies and that they work hand in hand so who knows. My grandfather was a freemason, but from what I read he was just a normal guy. I feel like I got a curse. He was a good guy. – Apparently _NAME_ is the bitcoin creator so there’s that. Saw it in the news. Last, there’s this guy named _NAME_ 2 that talks a lot of crap on YouTube and he’s been through a lot like me. He says he’s the real one, but I think I’m the real one… He’s been cloned too, apparently. Thought I was Q but I guess not. I have no memory. I buy the overall arching story and theme though. I lived it and seen it many times."

I remember when _NAME_ from the bible ( I think it was him) said he knows what he is doing is wrong but he does it anyways. I feel like _NAME_ always messing up somewhere although I should seek help and advice I continue on the same left path as the rest of my peers who look at life with a destructive end. I need to ask for help. This urge feels like a wanting but I am afraid it will soon turn into an obligation. I look back and wonder why can’t I be normal.

There is a group called “emotions anonymous” that is present in most cities in the U.S. Maybe you could find people to relate to there. Try to enjoy the simple things, like the view outside your window, or maybe a chocolate shake once a week. Try to find something that interests you, and do that."

174371693,"Not at all. I eat like a pig and don’t exercise anymore. I have black lungs from chain smoking and high bad triglycerides and bad cholesterol. We don’t eat healthy as a family even when growing up. The air quality around here is horrid. One of the worst in the nation. Growing up, I took care of myself. I did immense hygiene (showers 2-3 times a day) and ate semi-healthy and refused to eat out and drink soda and garbage. I was healthy and looked attractive. I was fit and good looking and my mind was sharp. I always pushed myself to my limit when working out and lifting weights. Now, I don’t do ????. I used to brush my teeth every day before schizophrenia. Now, it’s like once a month. My teeth are bright yellow and I have cavities. I have insurance but I have a copay and I feel too embarrassed. If things don’t change my teeth will be destroyed in a couple years. My front tooth is already cracked. People don’t understand how strong and powerful I was before schizophrenia. I was extremely m
otivated, high functioning, despite extremely mild aspergers syndrome. People thought I didn’t like people. That’s what they told me up front. I was kind of a jerk. I struggled growing up. I don’t really feel comfortable around people – never did; especially at parties and large groups. But I always survived and pushed myself. I have a bad case of schizophrenia and I find it atypical. Like I have vision and sensory disruption and damage that is driving me crazy and feeding my psychosis. The only thing I do that’s still Good is reading and learning a bit. It’s hard when it feels like I lost 10+ IQ points, but I can still learn or relearn advanced math and understand some quantum physics."

174371700,"Once a person is sufficiently healed from the brain injury causing schizophrenia, they won’t “synchronize” much, if at all. The _NAME_ public babble is very computery and disturbing. It’s supposed to sound like the random garble of people having random conversations, nothing intelligible or relevant to my life. I get this feeling there’s a duality to this experience, one is the “real” stuff happening, which is people just minding their own business and pursuing their interests and such, and the “computer overlay”, which is what kicks in when a person is brain damaged and churning out adrenochrome. It’s like a red flag of distress that the automatic governing system (the management in the “realm of consciousness”) reacts to in some fashion, through consciousness / dialogue alterations and putting positive (or negative) reinforcement on your path. This is good in small doses, they’re basically how “blessings” work, but if you can’t turn off the adrenochrome, it’s lit
erally like being smothered. That’s the _NAME_ show. It’s solvable though. Just heal the brain injury."

176116557,"Until you realise the difference between your normal self and a voice this is is going to be a problem. Voices are a part of yourself that says what you expect to hear. It is your subconscious tricking you that the voice is a real supernatural entity, when in fact it is not. You expect to see _NAME_ or someone that looks like him (in a car like his), and a sz mind always interlinks coincidences because that is how our mind works, whether it was him or not and _PERSON_ the links merge and you are lost in delusion. It is a human condition to see coincidence, but sz add meaning to it. That is the difference. The mind is programmed instinctively to see coincidence, and the normal mind lets go and dismisses it. The sz mind can’t. When you know this you can learn to let go by understanding that when you set out to see a white car you will see lots of them. Overthinking that white cars mean something is where it goes wrong. Hope this insight helps."

Other times similar figures would be desperate to grab my feet when I was distracted, like a stray dog might. This time however it mostly just observed from a safe distance. I would munch on a sandwitch, sip tea slowly and would check every five minutes. Still behind that broken diswahing machine? Yep. Better keep ignoring it. Many, many similar delusions.

176116603,I don’t see my pdoc often enough to know. I’m sure he does everything expected of him by our organization well. I imagine that most pdoc’s have a certain profile of client who they relate to best. It’s kind of hit or miss. If you have the money you can shop around for a pdoc that works best for you.
176116604,Time to go back on your meds I’m afraid. _USER_ID_: you’ve lost insight.
176116605,"This will probably become a religious discussion. For me, the answer is I don’t know. I’ve thought about it, and I have spiritual beliefs along the lines of this questioning, but since we can’t discuss religion, I’ll just say I don’t know."

176116610,I would not say I’m overly sensitive to what they do say. But instead that I am very sensitive to what they do say. I sort of think that’s normal though with family since family bonds run deep.
176116611,Oh ok. That makes sense. If you’re ready to go off lyrica let your pdoc know. I’m sure they’ll help you get off it. It’s great that you don’t need it anymore.

But since the diagnosis, I deal with racing thoughts, which are an inner monologue, maybe I even overthink in fact? I am just afraid about my future. Plus I feel my brain in my head by thinking so much with this monologue… But the most of the things are just some false or negative beliefs… _AT_MENTION_ , don’t take it bad cause some people doesn’t want to talk to you.

I can never escape them. They attack me in a multitude of ways in multiple nightmares every night also and upon awakening it’s straight back to having to listen to them.
174371722,yea and my parents have said the past three weeks they felt like they had their daughter back. The aggression side effects and suicidal thoughts have abated after a few weeks. Will I get them again if I stop taking it? I also had a huge headache this morning until I took the medication. It could have been something else. I think it’s helping me. But now i’m nervous to take it and I feel helpless. I feel more normal once they added the strattera. If I wasn’t on it I would be sleeping non stop like a vegetable. Please help me decide what to do. I’m really overwhelmed.
176116620,I’ve never had ECT but I’m not against it. It’s never been suggested by my psychiatrist. I’m mostly stable now on new medicine. I’m going to also start DBT soon as long as it’s covered by my insurance. I’ve heard it helps a lot.
176116621,I’ve been suicidal depressed back in the Spring of 2019. I used an antidepressant for a while but stopped taking it. It was a little different from my daily downs I was going on when I switched to Abilify.

I mean in some ways I have mixed thoughts about it being a bad thing for me the whole situation but it made me realize I’m lucky to be alright and I don’t think the drugs are worth it anymore. What drugs r u craving. I’m hoping I won’t need to self medicate anymore. Just take things I have prescribed. I hope my new med regiment makes the difference plus clarity. I’ve been slowly getting better 5 years on naltrexone in terms of my addicted mind and I think I don’t wanna do drugs anymore but won’t be counting days anyways. Also I don’t think alcohol is good. Some people may be able to handle a few beers or psychedelics or other drugs in moderation and I don’t regret most my experiences but not me at this point. I never wanna do ketamine again. Well I do but at the end it lead to poor decisions and worse ment
al health (I hope) for me. For a while it was helping my mental health but not at the cost of mania and psychosis. But it cured me a lot of bad things but not at a bad risk. It was hard to balance.

May you sleep well tonight and tomorrow will be a good day as well I’m Hoping everything will be alright for both of us

176116646,this happened several years ago. perhaps it has taken this amount of time/ experience to grow a conscience. or to appreciate social responsibility. i pocketed the money and i regret it. i wrote a letter to the gas station’s supervisor (i think it’s still the same person) asking if the man ever back into the store and left his info. i hope he did.
176116647,I’ve only played once at a friends house. It is VERY fun. Looks way easier than it is. I watched my friend play it in hard mode and was confident that I could beat it in easy mode. Man I got my butt handed to me the first song I played haha. It’s good exercise and super fun.

I should mention my career as a model, successful, was everything to me as I sacrificed for it. I have had all horrible symptoms that the gynoclamastic male patients experience. The prolactin levels, lacation, (lord) the pain, the growth in tissue. MY DOCTORS DISMISS ME! Mental health doctor, (I think) makes notes. Medical doctors assume I just want new boobs.

I also took a couple semesters of Spanish, and luckily 
I still have my Spanish textbook. although I sold my accounting and economics books. my improving memory and my new pursuits are just another reason to take it easy on the sauce.

176116723,"I have a deep cut on my one wrist. From a psychotic suicide attempt. Im not ashamed. Used to it. Long ago. I hate that i did that, but i was clueless. In my last psychosis i aimlessly scratched my other wrist all over. I wanted to die, realised i couldnt commit suicide and just scratched lightly with scissors because i was thinking of suicide and wouldnt do it. I was in deep psychosis and there was no intention, i had no clue what i was doing except playing with scissors. I dont want these scars. Im afraid people think i cut myself for attention or to hurt myself…and that is not the case. Im afraid of questions. Any ideas how to heal or cover them? Nice tattoo ideas perhaps?

176116836,"Hello Again _AT_MENTION_-Cotton!. I Have Been Called Some Things During My Stay Here. One of My Main Personal Complaints Kinda Used to Be, When Someone Would Say, “are you taking your meds”. Usually After I Would Post Something Slightly Creative. Only Slightly Insulting. But!, I Learned Something. Sometimes People Are Insulted By Someone’s Creativity. So They Try to Degrade The Creativity By Saying Something Along The Lines of, “YOU ARE NOT SOUNDING OF SOUND MIND”. Then Try to Grab Some Witnesses as if to Say, “SEE?!, SEE?!, HE""S NOT ON HIS MEDS, THROW HIM OUT!”. It Jus Makes That Person Look Foolish, And Insults Everyone’s Intelligence. My Advice to You is, Try And Gather All of Your Questions And Thoughts in One Thread. People Won’t Question Your Purpose And Won’t Insult You. (For The Most Part). It All Comes Down to Probability in The End. You Are Young. There is Much too Learn. And Mental, “illness” is a Confusing Puzzle in And of Itself. So. Try Not to Take it Too Seri

176116853,I’ve been on it consistently for about 3 or 4 years. I was on and off meds for a few years before that.
174371776,Yes I don’t always have sza in my sleep. Sometimes I dream of hospital and I’m hypomanic or psychotic but mostly I’m normal. For example I always have a normal sex drive in my dreams. Then when I wake up I’m back in indifference to it.
176116854,I hope you hate yourself forever.
176116855,Thanks _AT_MENTION_ !!!
176116856,"Not me, about the time I was first getting sick, a stranger on the bus had to kindly tell me that there was no one behind me that meant me any harm. I didn’t realize I was constantly looking over my shoulder."
176116857,How old is your son?
176116858,"Wow, that is so sad. I hope that you get lucky and maybe find someone you can stand to share your life with and avoid that scenario."
176116859,It felt like i smoked a really strong cigarette. I just felt really focused and wanted to make music and write some poems. Just felt really motivated.
176116860,I am guessing the sleepiness kind of effect is meant to relax you???
174371780,Thanks _NAME_ and do you think holding a job down is possible I’ve read about your park ranger and it’s amazing I’m joining forestry my self and it’s my 2nd year with schizophrenia and I can say I’ve turned my life around I stop drinking drugs going out with friends who influenced negatively and I just hope it does get better and my goal is to hold a career down
176116861,"It helped me a lot to realise that the content of my delusions was shaped by past experiences, mostly childhood. However, it still remains uncertain why did those experiences impact me so catstrophically. Was it purely biological condition? Something more? Did you think of this yourself?"
176116862,Why you stopped doing exercise? Maybe is the root cause of negativism.
176116863,It might’ve just been a one time normal occurrence but I heard people talking (not clearly) and it wasn’t a real voice Should I worry?
176116864,"No, my doctor can not read my mind, and he would tell me if he could and also his receptionist can not read my mind, also my sister whom I live with can not read my mind, and my parents"
176116865,Glad life is OK
174371786,"i got mild to moderate sinusitis and i also have schizophrenia, is it a coincidence? anybody had a ct scan and also had sinusitis?"
176116866,"Not all day, just when I wake up and for an hour or two right after."
176116867,That’s so great congrats!!
176116868,"Na. Getting diagnosed really made me self reflect. I think it’s just a reality of the process. Like upkeep has increased and for me to get through a lot of situations I have to be more focused on myself and what I’m doing. It’s not being selfish…it’s just survival. You can still be a kind human. You can still be a good brother, friend etc. I do think it’s unavoidable that the disorder makes you more insular and self focused. That is my take on it anyways."
176116869,When forced to engage with strangers I often feel my mind dissolves and starts to rise like incense left hovering over my head. I’ve experienced this for years -sort of proving that I suffer from DP/DR disorder rather than SZ- but assumed it was _NAME_ until I was told otherwise. Intense DP/DR mimics SZ symptoms so it’s not surprising that I should’ve been misdiagnosed. Have you ever experienced intense DR/DP?

176116871,"Yeah, I get that, but they didn’t need to go into detail. I’m sure they weren’t trying to be sinister though. It sounds like you have a good relationship with your brothers and that they help you. Probably just one of those heat of the moment comments that sometimes gets blurted out. I guess it’s not so bad if you also knew their friends as opposed to if they said it to someone you didn’t know."
176116872,"There used to be a guy on the forum whose doctor prescribed Naltrexone for his alcohol and opiate addiction. Verywell Mind Naltrexone for Maintaining Drug Abstinence by Eliminating Desire Naltrexone works by decreasing cravings for alcohol and blocking the effects of opiates, like cocaine and heroin. I don’t know if you want to go down that route, but I thought I’d let you know about it. That’s a brilliant idea ! You did the right thing."
174371787,my brother in law is a pain in the as*s…he is judgemental of me…he hears some crazy thngs I did as a sz and judges me harshly…he does nt talk to me and is aloof and cold…I think he thinks im a scumbag because I have doen crazy things as a schizophrenic how should I treat him…should I be charming and try to be nice or should I walk the other way

176116874,"Thank you, I will try to keep it in one thread, but it’s a big topic, the story is, I’m going back to court, to change my sentence because, they lied when they said I had delusions, about side - effects . . Yeah, I agree, I’ve not been violent, generally, other than a bit annoying and, weird . . in my life, the only time I got violent was, after I couldn’t take hormonal treatments and, also being Castrated, with Valproate ( not, an antipsychotic, a Mood - stabilizer ) . . When I found out, I got so incredibly suicidal and, sad . . I thought I was dead, it was over . . During that week, after finding out, I was i shock and, I got aggressive . . Before that and, after that . . No violence . ."

176116876,The DSM requires 2 symptoms from a list of 5. There are many possible combinations.
176116877,Im on 5mg at night. When did the paranoia subside? Im on week 2 and not paranoid but very anxious. _PERSON_ also coming off the invega shot… that was a terrible decision. My memory zapped from it.
176116878,My doctor thought I had them but Imm just sensitive because of autism
176116879,"The hallucinations are always like that, very pessimistic and hurtful. I had the “he’s near death” hallucination one time when my headache was pretty bad in a store, just ignore the nonsense. The voices used to want me to die too, but as my recovery progressed and my head hurt less and less, the voices got friendlier. I still hear them a little bit though, and we get into arguments still."

176116882,I’m glad things turned out better for you. Health professionals try their best but they are not always correct.
176116883,You’re not a mess. It’s a tough disease. If you can’t change your AP maybe you could talk to your doctor about the fact your antidepressant isn’t doing it’s job maybe. I’m sorry you’re suffering. Don’t give up though.

176116885,"It’s the same for me, I feel quite similar. I don’t think I’ll have a partner at all in the future which seems a bit bleak. I don’t like the thought of being dependent on being with parents for social need weirder."

176116887,I get them like that all the time. Along with fading of the mind.
176116888,"You’ve posted very similar in other threads , which differ very little from this one."
176116889,I do that too. I go over the conversation in my head over and over afterwards.
174371791,I remember that as a kid and teen I would sometimes do and say things that weren’t normal. It also didn’t help that I wasn’t very smart so I’d often do and say foolish things.
176116890,How sad. It is a terrible position to be in. My hope is she’ll meet someone who can help her.
176116891,"like i ocassionaly would get voices that when I looked at someone they would instantly tell me what ailment they had and how they were going to die. but I wouldnt like run up to that person or anything or tell them. my pdoc basically said for that stuff, if im managing it ok to just let it be. but if I was acting on the information then thats not good. seems like you got a handle on it, its just a nuisance for you."
176116892,When I do something like the “gaming” I sometimes feel a little loose and fear that I could get ill again. I don’t quite know what to do.
176116893,Just try more vegetarian and less dairy and grains.
176116894,Of course there are sz that come from solid families. It’s just there are a lot of dysfunctional families out there so it makes it seem like we’re all from dysfunction.

176116897,I was wondering what I should eat tomorrow maybe oatmeal in the morning and rice and chicken and lettuce for lunch. I did yoga today and sadly I thought I was hearing voices all though out the session on YouTube. which did not inspire me but was a let down.
174371792,Did you ever have intrusive thoughts?
176116898,Maybe you just need a break from work or vacations and time to relax?
176116899,"Well, I’ll answer this question specifically, though you are asking something else. It probably depends what country, city, state, county etc. that you live in. I’ve really never had that problem here in Northern California. I see psychiatrists through the clinics I go to near me, depending on where I live at the time and Medicare and Medicaid pay for them… It must be harder to see private shrinks. When I first got sick, the psychiatrist in the hospital came every two weeks and saw each patient for 5 minutes. Yep. (it was free). When I got released to the group home, a counselor gave me a list of all the psychiatrists in the vicinity who took Medicaid. I picked one at random that was close by and I ended up seeing him for the next 7 years. The rest of my psychiatrists after that have been the resident staff doctors at mental health clinics that were near me. And that’s how it still is."
174371795,"Well, you don’t really know for sure if you can or not. That sounds like the truth. So it’s not like you are trying to cheat them or anything. SSDI and SSI have rules made especially for disabled people on their roles so they can test the waters and see if they can work. Everybody knows about trial work periods. Those are made so you can try to work while still collecting benefits. One way of looking at working on SSDI is that your monthly check is a cushion. You can try to work and have some leeway. If you try to work you have that cushion so if you don’t succeed at working full time you have that monthly check as a safety net and you won’t end up on the streets. And if you find out you can’t work then no harm done, you will still be on their roles and have that monthly check continue regardless. The way SSDI works it makes you see what you can handle and what you can’t. If you can’t work a 40 hours week then try part-time. If working part-time will screw up your finances than work a
round it. Personally, I work part-time. I also collect a monthly check under their rules. They know my financial situation exactly, I’m not doing anything wrong according to their rules. I’ve tried a couple of times to get off SSDI and support myself and it just didn’t work. I make enough money now to satisfy me. If I get fired or quit and get another job and they ask me to work part-time fine. One thing I know about myself is that I can work a 40 hour week sometimes. Basically I found that I can handle any hours they give me at most of my jobs. I’ll sign up for part-time but if they occasionally schedule me to work a 40 hour week I have always been able to do it at any job. But I can’t see myself applying for a full time job and sustaining it for any significant amount of time. I’m 59 and I struggle with part-time. I just want to work a six hour day and come home and take a damn nap. And that’s what I do. And I’m satisfied and Social Security seems to be satisfied so I ain’t planning on roc
king any boats."

176116956,Recently I watched a movie called Rabbit hole. In it there is a concept of multiple reality or parallel universe. It seems to be interesting and it has opened up my mind somewhat. I tend to think so negative that I get stuck a lot. But I kind of try to think now multiple realities to a situation and I don’t get over stressed because of the event or situation. I rather think there is more to the event and that sets me free for now.
176116957,"Only if I were in therapy or had a breakthrough remission where I was told I could reduce or stop the medications. As I get older my symptoms don’t really change but my perspective has increased. I would advise not to come off all meds or to find something that works. I don’t want to even remember my episodes because I’m sure I had some scary times. I am not someone who becomes violent/still I don’t want to be stuck in a delusional cycle. I’ve seen what it does to my mom. I’ve seen how it affects people around me. It hurts to be afraid of your loved ones and family. I still wish I could be free of taking pills every day. The more I fantasize about it the more I have wondered if I should take monthly injections. If I keep taking them as prescribed I can avoid that though, so I take the medications. I can’t tell if it helps anymore, but I believe it does–as opposed to my worst episodes. Abilify keeps me from becoming manic or psychotic, and helps with paranoid delusions. I can’t cha
nge my eccentric or spiritual beliefs about God etc. but I can control how I perceive the world by not falling off the deep end… I tried non-identification with the label schizophrenia, and I tried going off the medications. It seemed to be ok temporarily but then I lost insight. Insight is the most important survival mechanism in humanity. If you lose insight then you can become a victim to others’ or abuse. My psychiatrist let me go off of the medication Abilify when I was sixteen. It took about 4-6 months and then I was completely unreachable, I spiraled into the delusions. I was doing strange things, like painting in the nude, or stealing my parents car and driving to town, it was all chaos. I dropped out of HS. Nearly ruined my life because then coming back to reality was even harder. I nearly didn’t come back. That’s how far gone I was. It took my mom about two years to come back from her psychosis. It took her about 4 weeks to dissolve into more delusional episodes when she stopped Haldol. It t
ook about 4 months of intervention to convince her to go back on Haldol. Not all medications have bad side effects. Good luck. I’m currently having a different internal battle: I’m enjoying the relief from anti-depressants but I know anti-depressants can cause psychosis in some people and I’m not sure if I should continue taking it even when its helping with so much, I just dont know if the short-term benefits are worth it and my conscience is conflicted about it. I usually know the answer to things, but God hasn’t told me not to take this medication just that it has a negative/association and I have the choice. You have the choice either way, just think of fallback plans and what to do if your mind starts racing or you get paranoid about things. If I had the choice to express myself fully and live without medications 100 percent I would live med-free. I’m just not sure of what to expect or how long it would take for stress to push me over the edge/or if I could learn better stress coping skills ins
tead if I could come out of this disease. That’s what I’ve been trying to do my whole life and it hasn’t happened yet, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it can’t. It’s a matter of perspective sometimes. Some people do recover. I would like to start new, the more I think about it the more I feel like getting a new psychiatrist and a second opinion. I think its time for a change, I may do this pretty soon. I need to change and adapt and this will probably help. That’s all I’ve got haha, sorry for rambling"
176116958,He’s a very good doctor. I like how he works.
176116959,That’s so weird… synchronicities and coincidences…
174371813,Bless your heart _AT_MENTION_ I missed you
176116960,What is Something?. I Ask.
176116961,Hey thanks I’m glad to have these tools. I’d be a mess without em.
176116962,Thanks for sharing _NAME_. You’ve got a wealth of life experience and you made it out of the clutches of drug addiction. Good on you dude
176116963,I had a big crush on this one girl in high school. I daydreamed a lot. Nothing materialized.
176116964,glad to hear you’ll be sticking around.
176116965,I’m considering asking the doc to increase my Clozapine dose and get me off Abilify Maintena Is this a good idea
176116966,"Just rapping emceeing. You don’t need to make beats to be successful in rap by any means. I’m not saying I’m gonna become billboard top 100 next summer. But I think by next summer I’d like to pursue a music career. I’ve doubted myself I’ve thought about it. I’ve thought about it more. And I finally think it’s in my front ahead sights. Not to blow up. But just to pursue a career. This means making a music video. I wanna wait for my 30th birthday. Also my job trial period will be over a little before next summer. I wanna be on the road. Go to shows. I notice a lot of ppl who spit flows. These days. Are on the road. A while before they get higher. In the industry. Maybe I’d blow up in five years. But I think I’m almost ready to truly share my music to the world. Maybe it will flop but it’s worth a try. Make a serious song next summer with a producer in studio and release a music video. And see where it can take me. I really think this song I made is dope. My sister said it inspir
ed her I know a lot of ppl here haven’t given my music a chance in a little while. And I still have a long way to go till next summer. But I can see myself now. lol. It’s just what I love to do. And I’ve had a lot of support in my life in the pursuit of music. A lot of people told me I should do it. And I think I’m on my way. If u don’t agree, then o well. Peace"

176116969,"How do you know its not the meds that are helping? Were you able to stop meds with psychtherapy? Only meds stopped my psychosis. I wasted 200$ and 45min on psychotherapy, the psychologist was just feeding my delusions and my brain just made new delusions everytime. Meds stopped that, no more delusions."

176116976,I didn’t experience these but ask your psychiatrist.
176116978,"I’m doing good. Looking for work. I have been working at a salvation army second hand shop for the last few years as an extra, but after corona they have limited opening hours, so no work for the last 5-6 months. Hope it gets better.

176116979,"then don’t complain about ending up in the ward, then. Because that’s what will happen. You need to consult your pdoc."
176116980,I’ve read it’s from the higher incidence of single parent households.
174371817,I switched to chew. It’s supposedly healthier.
176116981,Good luck man. My Pdoc raves about it. Hope it helps you
176116982,I feel the next vista is in electronics that help you heal faster internally. Like this PEMF device I’m using. Studies show it can really do that.
176116983,No but I really do miss that manic energy I used to have! I don’t get out of first gear anymore…before the pills I had overdrive!
176116984,Went it was okay. I’m being yelled at by my ok. I think he therapist

176116986,I was. Which I was very grateful for as physical illness always seems to negatively impact my mental health. I’m still a bit more depressed than usual but fine otherwise.
176116987,Probably if you just type my name in the messaging pm box it should work if you ever have any other questions. Honestly it might be OK for you the 10mg…not really sure just give it 3 to 4 months it is true it takes time for the med to adjust in your body and invega to disappear
176116988,"_PERSON_… Any more info on this stuff? Did you keep taking it? I’m just now getting into reading about it, and have some capsules on order from Amazon. Anyone else here tried it?"
176116989,It’s 7:15am here. Just drinking coffee and waking up. Excited because I have my first baby scan this morning.
174371820,I like your jokes _AT_MENTION_
176116990,For mental health awareness month I would like to positives vibes on our recovery. To help those that are struggling as will as help those to keep succeeding in there recovery. Starting Monday I will start a conversation on a subject about Mental health awareness. If any of you have something you would like to suggest to make as a topic please comment!
176116991,"When i buy new books, I spend my whole day reading. It distracts me absolutely"
176116992,I totally forgot about _PERSON_! I only remembered _PERSON_.
176116993,_PERSON_ which is very short when you off the rails.
176116994,Looks like I’m dealing with the drinking posts okay today.
174371821,"That’s what I always say… so I have schizoaffective disorder, I’m not as attractive as I’d like to be, I’m alone most of the time, I have no career… but still, I’m just happy to be alive. Considering how old the planet is, it’s fantastic luck for us to even exist in the middle of a cold and mostly lifeless universe. We’ve hit the cosmic jackpot in a way. I just love absorbing all of mankind’s art and entertainment, and that’s enough for me most days. I’m glad you found a support group, that’s awesome!"
176116995,"I think schizophrenics are entitled to at least try to get off meds, if they want. Just to see if life gets better or worse. Like, I just got off my meds, it’s day 3, and things are getting marginally worse, but bearable. I’m waiting on a PEMF device to heal my brain, to see if it can flip my situation for the better. If that doesn’t work, I might just go back on meds."
176116996,"Honestly, no. It’s a waste of time I could spend Doing Things. I begrudgingly get the required amount of sleep because I fall to pieces if I don’t."

176116999,Before i got sz i wanted to get income insurance. My mother talked me out of it. I would have been better off signing it.
176117000,I really like when people post these. Thank you. I got to play with my dad’s dog today. Everyone is out of the house so my anxiety is down. I am excited to talk to my SO later:)
176117001,That’s how my visits usually are about 5 minutes and I only see my pdoc twice a year
176117002,haha feel my pain. Off peak just hit 40. So sad. Could have been great for the country now just a joke on the world stage… No sympathy my friend. We got totally cooked!

176117005,I’d seek urgent medical help if I was in your position.

176117009,"I figure it triggered me back then because it reminded me of memories and emotions I wasn’t ready to process. I’ve made a lot of progress with that these 11 years, so hopefully I’m able to start making more positive associations with the song"

176117012,"hi _AT_MENTION_. Typically, we like to leave inactive threads alone and just start a new thread instead. This is different than how some forums are run, but we do it this way because it frequently upsets users to have old topics revived when they are no longer relevant. It can also be frustrating to the person who revived the thread when they don’t get a reply, because the original poster is no longer active or no longer finds the topic relevant. Feel free to start a new thread on this topic. Thanks, Ninjastar Volunteer Moderator"
176117013,I’m doing this too. It’s the only thing keeping me sane.

174371829,"Why not Risperdal? You had serious side effects from it? Remember there is no perfect med for sz, that’s what my psychiatrist said. I recently switched from Latuda to Risperdal and my thinking is more positive with slightly less negative and cognitive symptoms. I have tried Abilify, Olanzapine, Latuda and Risperdal was the best. We don’t really have other meds here in Canada."
174371827,Does it help organize your thoughts?

176117021,Probably best to wait and see how your current med change affects you before you go adding more AP’s in.
176117022,I managed to get an English degree while having some pretty severe symptoms. It’s definitely possible.

176117025,"I think I’ve spoken of this before on the board, but I read a study that showed that the brains of schizophrenics were built slightly differently. Larger capillaries Etc. When someone with this brain structure is traumatized in some way, schizophrenia becomes a very real possibility. Of course, there are many schizophrenics who were born with the disorder. I found the article very interesting, but I cannot speak to its validity"

176117029,What APs are you on?
176117031,I bought some books about psychiatry and I have learnt a lot.
176117032,It does concern me how everything is shutting down due to the virus. I previously said I’m not worried and I am not all that scared for myself even though I have issues that could make me a victim of it. I am fearful for my Mom and other older folks in my family. However I hope that no matter how it plays out though that we can get back to just living again normally. Kids make fun of death on Halloween. It’s a shame we have to forget that dying is just a part of life and there are many things that can kill us. We can’t live like cave people the rest of our lives.
176117033,I can’t change. My life is a mistake.
176117034,double likes for no side effect if it’s true :))
176117035,They don’t believe me. I have tried to tell them about my mental health in a serious was. I was very downplayed
174371833,I’m diabetic. 121 blood sugar levels are not so bad.

176117037,"I’m Catholic and it sometimes interferes with my spiritual life. When I was very delusional, I went to see a priest about it because I thought something was trying to possess me. When I finished my confession, the priest said, “Please go to the ER right now. You’re not well and if not go see a psychologist.” I actually took his advice and went to the ER. When I was in Canada, my priests were aware of my mental health condition and they often helped me when I was delusional or psychotic. My advice would be to talk to your priests about what’s going on (you don’t have to disclose your mental illness) and ask them for advice."
176117038,yea liking yourself is a good thing… i disliked myself long time… now i’m ok with myself
176117039,i ask my tattoo artist his said its okay to use. sorry for asking guys.
176117040,Once. We were not in love. It was just meaningless sex. _PERSON_ like I might be Asexual after it happened. Just don’t see the big deal. Of course maybe if I meet someone who I have actual feelings for then I would likely change my opinion. But _PERSON_ unable to trust enough to ever be capable to have a real relationship in all probability. Its just the way it is.
176117041,"Ah, that is such an oversight. Don’t stop your meds without a doc’s guidance."

176117044,my doc never encourage me to talk he always tell me to ignore and never talk about any thing
176117045,At this point in time i don’t feel like I even want anyone in my life … I kept asking him for marriage and now he says he wants to I’m focused on marring a celeb who is dead … basically I am fine on my own now and don’t need anybody ever I need to get a dog my mum finally agreed
174371836,I get severe apathy all day if I don’t leave the light on when I sleep. Leaving the light on in the bedroom all night reduces my negative symptoms by about 50%. I discovered this when I bought an eye mask and some blackout curtains and became severely apathetic a few days later.
176117046,But people said to me that a psychotic person wouldn’t be able to do calculus

176117049,When unmedicated I had suicidal thoughts and actually executed them. On meds I have suicidal thoughts but never execute them.
176117050,Maybe it’s because you are taking two ap at the same time which is why you are too tired
174371837,Are you symptoms free
176117051,I have the herpes cold sore virus…it only flares up on my facial lip once or twice per year. I have no idea how I picked that up. I have pills to take for it when it starts to flare up.
176117052,"the therapist forced you??? what kind of treatment is it? I is so scared to ruin our trust, that even when he argued with me to go to the hospital, he gave me the free will to chose… how can a therapist brack that trust? i hope that you found your self a new one"

176117054,"In official studies, I believe 1000 mg was the minimum effective dose as an antipsychotic. That is obviously way too expensive to be practical right now. I take 10 mg morning and night, and it helped my anxiety enough that I was able to stop my anxiety med last year."
176117055,"That’s fine. A lot of people do. I kind of did at first, but – Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to watch then to make a more certain judgment and determine if it really isn’t healthy long-term for society to adopt a model of thinking that is like a silent ‘poison’. The concepts she presents are not easily grasped or accepted for the reason it can be painful to address wounds that we think we’ve healed from."
176117056,If you don’t want to throw away the relationships completely just tell them you’re sorry for ignoring them but you don’t have the energy to socialize. If you didn’t want people period you probably wouldn’t be posting on forums. You probably just want less interactions.

176117058,"Nothing wrong with asking to be paid for what you think you’re worth. Employers are actually more impressed with the potential employee who asks for the higher wages. If you ask for more than the other applicants because you figure you’re worth more, the employer approves of that. Just don’t price yourself out of a job though by asking for too much, ask for a reasonable wage. But if you get hired at a good wage, you better be able to perform well enough at your job so the employers feels they’re getting their money’s worth."
176117059,"I’m a bit of an oddball like that even as a sober person. One funny time my gf likes to remind me of is When I was at this department store shopping with her. At the cashier line up I saw this little flying drone toy and was like “OH COOL” and I picked it up and started zooming it around in front of the cashier’s area. I was in my own little world so excited with this flying toy when my gf was like “their telling you to stop” I’m like “no way your lying no one said anything” i keep playing and she tells me again and again “please stop playing with it they are telling you to stop” so I finally put it down. The cashier lady was actually yelling “SIR” excuse me SIR , EXCUSE ME SIIIIIIR SIR!!! And I couldn’t even hear her cuz I was so focused on playing. Yeah I can be embarrassing to take out in public sometimes lol"
176117060,Usually a running commentary

176117062,Good morning everyone
176117063,I seriously doubt if your doctor knows you hear voices that he will stop your medication _AT_MENTION_ . You don’t have to worry about that.
174371842,best of luck with it all _AT_MENTION_ I hope you feel better soon and can get home safely.
176117064,I still think the “voice” inside of me is psychic.
176117065,How are things going for you? What have you been up to? What are you doing today?
176117066,I thought Canada had amazing health insurance…
176117067,I have intrusive thoughts and prozac helps me loads with it
176117068,"im doing pretty good on meds. i’ve had brief night time voices 3 times in the last 4 months, and nothing during the day. everything is pretty quiet. im on invega trinza. been on it 4 months now. the highest dose. side effects are minimal for me, as i’ve gotten used to the med i think. early on with invega sustenna, i had more side effects, like tremors in hands, jaw clenching, akathisia, anhedonia but those went away after 16 to 18 months. now my only side effects, are slower metabolism and i have a tough time staying cool in the summer heat. which i just learned was a side effect of some meds."
176117069,I understand that. When my grandfather was dying the whole family was basically camped out together so we could be with him in his final moments. I pray your family gets through this rough time together.
176117070,"Oh, okay. I could not remember if I was breast fed when I was a baby or not."
176117071,At least you know that about yourself and act accordingly. That’s really wise.
176117072,Voices drive me crazy . They say I’m gonna die and my heart beats irregularly . I am confused
174371843,How does Abilify Pills compare with the injection? Why can’t the injection be used for depression?
176117073,I am taking meds
176117074,And what an odd experience it is… I hope we all overcome this.
176117075,It causes heat stroke in some patients. Maybe excessive sweating was cuz of this ? You get sweating after exercise or sweating comes for no reason ?
176117076,"They’re so mean that I can only say that what they do is torture, and I would never torture myself. Half the time, I don’t even know what they’re talking about. It wouldn’t make sense to say I don’t know what my own mind is talking about. They emphasize things that I don’t think are important at all. They lie about what my thoughts are. I’ve had them for ten years, and I don’t think I’ll ever think of them as internal. I believe that something external is deliberately torturing me."

176117079,Yes that’s true. I am much better. I can’t even imagine my self without meds
176117080,With willpower or resilience you can make a difference to what you expect of a bad prognosis. Believe in yourself
176117081,What’s that? And yeah better to see your Dr before it gets worse.
176117082,I’m talking about the nurse practitioner not my boyfriend.
176117083,Yeah just in case. We’re you tested _AT_MENTION_?
176117084,Stress. I live a lo stressed lifestyle and live pretty well. I control most of my life so I avoid stress. That is my key to better living!
176117085,"No. This should not affect your ability to get a job. Most countries have legal protections for workers with disabilities that force employers to give equal consideration to employees. The US is way behind most counties in this area, but even here employers do not see medical records."
176117086,In all honesty - i dont think anyones paranoia with Sz truly goes away. You might just have to learn to live with it. If im not sure about something or what was said i always “Check it out” - dont worry if you come across as a bit mad or not when you ask them. At least that way you dont worry about it all day.
176117087,omg they said they took away my private messaging ability… that sucks I was pming naturallycured
176117088,"Most people won’t lose benefits, but I will. I had my loans forgiven because of my disability, and to give me new loans, the government wants a letter saying that I am capable of gainful employment. That would negate my disability. It seems unfair, though. I can still pay student loans on disability even if I can’t work. It gives me no chance to improve my situation. It sucks,."
176117089,I am glad I don’t have that then. I am a 100% disabled veteran and that’s over $3000 a month and the VA doesn’t consider a personality disorder a disability so I wouldn’t be getting that then.
176117090,Voices give to me !!! I see words from sexual perspective Any good way to stop that ?
176117091,I always wanted to take steroids. A guy I went to college with took them and started out chubby and had a 6 pack and muscles when school resumed after summer break. But I wouldn’t want them now. I took resperidone and I might have low testosterone too I was on it for 5 years. Hmmm
176117092,No. That’s a little extreme health f an analogy

176117117,I hope this keeps working for you _AT_MENTION_ . It’s good to come up with any rational plan that will make you happier and get some relief.
176117118,Welcome to the forum!
176117119,I finished getting my bachelor in education when I was diagnosed in my sophomore year.
176117120,I’m planning on taking the ultimate fighting classed in a couple of months…around then.
176117121,I’m really impressed with your work. Nice job!
176117122,"Good for you for making progress! The first two bags gone must feel really good. Sounds like you’re off to a great start! I understand what you mean about strangely liberating, I felt the same way when I got divorced (I am remarried now). I took very little, and then I moved to Canada less than a year later. I didn’t even bother to sell things, I donated it all to the abused women’s shelter when I left for Canada. Keep looking forward to your next chapter to keep you motivated. It becomes addictive once you get a good start and goes much faster."

When I say it triggers hallucinations I mean primarily visual ones, I have always tried imagining stuff to music but now the hallucinations muddle and change the images I think of, which gets me angry. So I try not to think while I’m listening to music if that makes any sense."
176117126,I don’t think you are a failure. I think you’re OK.
174371845,I was not approved first when I only said I have Aspergers because that’s what my mum told me to say because she refuses to accept my schizophrenia diagnosis despite over seven psychiatrist have diagnosed me and despite me telling her about voices and delusions etc. She said there’s too much _USER_ID_ to it. I think she finds it embarrassing. She still refuses to accept. I was approved when I wrote that I have schizophrenia and a psychiatrist confirmed and I said over seven psychiatrist have diagnosed me. I did so against my mothers will. I still have not told her as she would get mad at me saying now I have a label on me etc It was really upsetting to apply and stressful and the beauracracy is difficult for me. Thankfully somehow I managed. It helps me so much.

For some reason i dont remember my childhood before 2010. Like i went back in time nearly infinitely. I remember traumatic stuff now. I became religious in 2017. Maybe they split or compartmentalized my brain. I remember history changing all the time. Stuff i mentioned before.

It was hard to prove but I could’ve sworn that a screenshot he PMed me was of my computer screen. He also said something out of the blue, that seemed straight out of my dad’s inner monologue. He said a lot of things out of the blue that made me question my own paranoia. I think though for your sake, you should define some terms and spoon feed it to the forum a little more. For one, I don’t think people know what gaslighting is all about. I say the same about myself on _PERSON_ syndrome. Can you describe more what that entails?"

176117148,I know you’re going through a lot right now. But if you’re feeling like hurting yourself then you need to speak to someone in real life. A doctor would be ideal. But you also have your brother. You could talk to him too. Stay fighting _AT_MENTION_ .

My English class was doing some PowerPoint to present, and most of my close friends were in one group and I was like by myself. So, I thought it would be funny to act like the hacker group anonymous hacked into the PowerPoint. I even created a fake email and somehow got access to their PowerPoint and invited my alias email account to the work. Well, they found out and while my friends thought it was funny, (kind of) the school and my parents were not so enthralled. Here I was, 14 years old, crying like a baby when my dad got home from work. Luckily, the school didn’t do much because it was like three days away from the end of the year. I felt like I had commited an unpardonable sin. My class was stalled for three days to undo the damage I caused. All while I was home “sick” for three days."

174371851,"Welcome to the community! I’m sorry you’re not happy with your meds. Do they give you unpleasant side effects? If so, there are plenty of others to try. I do have a question. Every time you heard someone ask about the reflection in their eyes, had you been high/tripping? Because if not, those were probably indicative of a psychotic disorder. If you were under the influence, it could have just been the drugs messing with your mind. Do you still take any drugs? If so, it would be a good idea to stop. Even if you only had one psychotic episode, it’s important to stay away especially from hallucinogens. They make it more likely that you’ll have a second episode, and a second episode makes it more likely your condition will be permanent. For a single psychotic episode, doctors usually recommend being on meds for at least a year and a half after symptoms completely disappear, but different doctors have different recommendations. This is because psychotic episodes cause physical brain damage, and 
actually shrink the grey matter. For example, I went ten years without treatment. On my most recent MRI, the notes said “Significant loss of gray matter for a person of their age.” That was enough to convince me I need my meds."

On meds he comes from once or twice a week up to once a month Off meds/in relapse he comes for short stretches several times a day How do I cope? Distraction. Reading. Music. Or talking to someone. Because if I’m by myself doing nothing I’d talk to him instead and he’d start tormenting me and laughing at me. If I ignore him he goes gradually away. He’s like a big bully."

We’re just people, living for a short while on this planet. I’m not judging people, I’m judging you. You cast delusional posts here all the time and refuse to take your medication.

But on a better note, _PERSON_ is great for learning to cook. My daughter since taking over the cooking, does a lot from there or uses it as a guideline. I mean, my basics are frying boneless skinless chicken breast in margarine and coating it with a dredge of flour, lawry’s seasoned salt, garlic and onion powder. Fry till brown on both sides and crispy, usually not too hard to cook thoroughly because the breasts I buy are kinda flattish to begin. Then pouches of 4 cheese _NAME_’s instant mashed taters, and we’ve got a rice cooker that she just starts whenever she gets up for the day. Yeah, we’re not at all a fresh food family, everything is canned or frozen. Only fresh I buy is apples and potatoes, but have bad luck with potatoes cause there’s usually a unseen rotten one in the middle, and then the whole bag is shot.

I feared for my life and feared for my family. I think I’m seriously being watched and monitored. I sincerely believe Jesus is protecting me from harm. I thought it was purgatory or worse. It really did happen. But I’m fine now. I’m safe. I have accepted God."
176117225,"Focusing on love is good, stick with that as opposed to the negative things these entities are saying. They have told me that everything is “love” aka all the experiences people have whether it is good or bad, it is all love they said.

It is definitely not easy, but I feel it is easier for my mind/body/soul to do this. Stay strong _AT_MENTION_, you got this!"

174371866,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov The Relationship Between Cognitive Dysfunction and Symptom Dimensions Across Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder. _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Song, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ Sun, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, Frontiers in psychiatry , 2019 Background: Cognitive dysfunction is considered a core feature among schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD). Despite abundant literature comparing cognitive dysfunction among these disorders, the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and symptom dimensions remains unclear. The study aims are a) to identify the factor structure of the BPRS-18 and b) to examine the relationship between symptom domains and cognitive function across SZ, BD, and MDD. Methods: A total of 716 participants [262 with SZ, 104 with BD, 101 with MDD, and 249 healthy controls (HC)] were included in t
he study. One hundred eighty participants (59 with SZ, 23 with BD, 24 with MDD, and 74 HC) completed the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), and 507 participants (85 with SZ, 89 with BD, 90 with MDD, and 243 HC) completed the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). All patients completed the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: We identified five BPRS exploratory factor analysis (EFA) factors (""affective symptoms,"" ""psychosis,"" ""negative/disorganized symptoms,"" ""activation,"" and ""noncooperation"") and found cognitive dysfunction in all of the participant groups with psychiatric disorders. Negative/disorganized symptoms were the most strongly associated with cognitive dysfunctions across SZ, BD, and MDD. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cognitive dysfunction severity relates to the negative/disorganized symptom domain across SZ, BD, and MDD, and negative/disorganized symptoms may be an important target for effective cognitive remediation in SZ, BD, and MDD."

A lot of boys are encouraged to just play and get messy, while little girls are taught housekeeping and relationship-building."

174371882,"When I first got ill in 2003 I had severe anxiety and mood swings, and danced down the road with earphones on and I cut my hair in a bizarre style and my mom was horrified with me. I believed evil spirits were trying to infiltrate my mind after my mom took me to get exorcism. I wrote all over my bedroom walls and paced and paced. I cut my arm numerous times. I went into remission in 2007 and came off my meds and became all religious. I wanted to be a nun and I fasted and slept on floor and practised penance like wearing a crown of thorns and whipping my back. I cut all my hair off and covered it with scarf. A little voice told me I’m a saint. And I did want to be one. Fast forward to after my relapse in 2012 - I believed my mother in law is trying to control me and poison my food. And I have two spirits in my head - Alien the evil spirit and _NAME_ the good spirit. Alien tries to control me and tells me to kill my husband and that I’m a murderer. I get severe depression and sometimes also hypom
ania. And I’ve cut myself more times. I still also get urges to cut all my hair off - I did this at least one more time since my nun days. And if it weren’t for my husband I’d do it again and again. I have these urges to roam the streets and dance down the road again… but didn’t get that far"

He also said, that ive tried too many meds in fact, that this probably smashed me too… I was never active, i drag this illness since kid so i was a zombie since small Thats how is my illness. I was never ok even before the illness. I have a tough family history, maybe thats why… But how so the meds make go outside my friends after months only and me, i still dwell my unhappiness? Tbh, i stopped switching aps as i was advised by my ex pdoc. Now i pay efforts, it got a bit better with that… But my sz is 
strange, idk… Its chronical too, not by episodes… I have thinking deficits as well and probably negatives aside from the paranoia… One doc was saying to me, that my zyprexa can work in years for me, but this looks as a lie to me, isnt it? One doc was thinking that i can have borderline, is it possible? I dont complain, but yeap, my mom still thinks, that i’ll always be in pain… While the parents of my ill friends never say this to them… Why my mother is seeing me like this for god sake??? I have no choice now except continuing my efforts, but it sucks, that the meds dont work on me much… Maybe i would be worse without them though, yeah… But i am unhappy as hell per moments, so lonely and feeling so unloved … I dont understand why my mother doesnt see any future for me, i suffered on this already alone even as kid.

A deaf person still has the auditory signals in the brain, even if they have never heard an actual voice.

176117427,"I think I should tell you all this. In 2012/13, I faced an extremely unusual experience. Due to the events that I observed, I ended up thinking that people know my thoughts, certain scriptwriters are writing scripts for me, people on TV/radio know me, etc. In other words, I had various delusions. The cause behind these so-called unshakeable delusions was due to the phenomena that I observed in my daily life. Nothing made sense to me initially. I also had many arguments with my friends. However, after 2 years’ time, I finally understood that human thoughts and actions are being affected in a way where their verbal and nonverbal actions correlated with my thoughts and actions. I managed to recognize this phenomenon as synchronicities. So, I came out of all these so-called unshakeable delusions without seeking psychiatric help. These are nothing more than erroneous conclusions that I had to understand the phenomenon that I observed. I wrote my story here: https : // insightfulreports dot wordpress d

176117491,I don’t know… My psyciahtrist at a ward often played with my delusions and wanted to see where I come from. Often psydocs use this tactic to see how structured and deep are you with your delusions. They do this to see if you actually need more medication or hospitalization.

The criminals are what cause me to have paranoia and sleepness nights. I get so scared… But with the way things are going, I either suspect things will get worse or improve.

176117506,There is outrage as there is a grits shortage. It turned out the grits were being made in a plant in India which was hit by the virus. Public school students are being taught at the county jail because it’s the biggest and best built building in the county and they want profiles of the students for future reference. 80% felt the government was lousy in a local poll but would vote for it again if its candidates were running against a candidate of the opposite party or color (true in the case of minority members of the government as well.) It rained 10 inches in the area. Officials called it a once a year flood because what previously happened once every 500 years now happens once a year. A local female newscaster was the first plus sized woman to be hired by the newscast. They fired her the next day because she put a fake video of a petite blond in her online resume. The blond in the video was contacted and hired instead. There was an attempt to topple the Confederate monument at the court square o
n July 4th with a firecracker. A repair crew made up of illegal aliens fixed it in 10 minutes. The instigator was put into jail for 40 years. The quarantine was put back into place because “folks didn’t behave” and the hospital was about to be overrun.

Only over time did I start to forget about the delusion and return to normal. When I started hearing voices it only took me 3 weeks to gain insight because the voices of my neighbors followed me to work. I think the breakthrough that can be made is when you can put the pieces together and see that they don’t add up.

All were also assessed using the Clinician-Rated Dimensions of Psychosis Symptom Severity (CRDPSS) Scale and the Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale.The mean subject age was 27.5 ± 4.5 years. No significant differen
ces in the SAS scores occurred between gender, jobs, and level of education. The Pearson r-correlation test showed that the SAS scores were significantly positively correlated with HADS anxiety, PSS, and BFI-10 neuroticism scores; it was negatively correlated with RSES, BFI-10 agreeableness, and conscientiousness scores. In the stepwise linear regression analysis, the severity of PSU was significantly associated with both high anxiety and low agreeableness.Our results suggest that specific groups of patients with schizophrenia may require special care to prevent problematic smartphone use."

174371942,"I remember when I was 19, freshly diagnosed and living in my first group home. I had no job or car or anything else for that matter and the counselors sent me downtown to Social Security to apply for benefits. I mean just a month before that I was just a 19 year old kid living with his parents, watching TV most of the day and occasionally going jogging in the hills. And then came my first psyche ward and from there, directly to this group home. And I could barely apply for a bus pass or library card but here I was on the fourth floor of this huge office building I had never been to before, by myself, with my paranoid schizophrenia, filling out a 5 page form. When the form asked, “What’s the nature of your disability and why are you applying?” I didn’t want to look bad and write “schizophrenia” so I wrote, “Emotional problems.” Lol, well big news: Social Security doesn’t give someone $800 a month for “emotional problems”. I got denied of course and my parents called up social s
ecurity and asked them why I got denied. They told them what I had wrote and my parents were a little bugged at me for messing up the application but they felt sorry for me and a year later they hired a lawyer who went to our church and by this time I was in the hospital and our lawyer/friend got all the forms and my medical records and a bunch of other forms and info for an appeal and actually came into the hospital to see me and had me answer some questions and sign a bunch of papers. He told me what I used to hear all the time. He told me I didn’t look or sound like I was mentally ill and if he didn’t know it already he never would have guessed. But yeah, I guess I’m just saying to not worry about looking bad when you’re applying for benefits. Go ahead and tell your lawyer or the judge the gritty details of what actually living with schizophrenia is truly like. Don’t sugar coat it. Don’t tell every weird delusion or say a bunch of crazy stuff but just be honest about how much it screws up your

I just saw interviews of several people (10 or so) who recovered from sz and are now healthy and medfree. So it is possible. I use a low amount of meds (0.5mg haldol, which is the minimum childrens dose). This works for me and the dose is bearable. Dont worry too much about the diagnosis.

So far I have just talked to them to see if I met the KSAs. Haven’t interviewed yet but probably will soon. I told the recruiter I talked to I thought my Secret clearance was still interim and hadn’t been adjudicated yet. It has been a while since my investigation. I think it was in 2017 or 2018. The lady emailed me today. They looked up my clearance and it was finally adjudicated and is active. I was honest with the investigator who interviewed me. I met her at the VA and gave her all my medical records. I was really sick and my records aren’t good. Someone here told me a schizophrenic would never get a clearance. I used to have a Top Secret SCI though and now I just have a secret. Little accomplishment to note. We can still do some stuff.

We listen to music, play games, laugh and mostly have a good time. My sister and nieces all work hard to contribute to household and I aim to contribute too with money my husband gives me. And later with disability money and hopefully a work from home job. I’d like to do proofreading. And maybe writing and painting. I spoke to hubby on phone this afternoon and he was all soft and gentle with me and said he wants to change for better. But I don’t want to go back to him because he’s said it before and reverted back to his negative and argumentative ways. I love him but he saps my energy and time and I’m tired of nursing him and looking after him and having hardly any time to myself I told him I want a separation for a while, but plan to tell him soon I want it to be permanent separation (ie. divorce) just so he can gradually get used t
o idea. I don’t want to hurt him, and I want to stay friends. This I told him and he took it ok. We will chat again and keep in touch. I still have to tell him of appt I made with judicial council to start divorce proceedings. I just need to give him a week or so to chat more and get adjusted to idea. I still feel quite at peace at idea of divorcing him. Just feel sorry for him but I think we will be better people separately. Its not only his illness and negativity that weighs me down but my sza and borderline illness too. It’s not fair on him that we struggle so hard. I can’t meet his needs and vice versa.

176117610,My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer 2 years ago at age 60. I decided to go get screened and they found two growths in my lungs at age 42. They said the growths in my lungs were to small to be considered cancer and to come back next year. Well next year was this past April and I never went back because of covid. I was told not to go near a hospital. So I went back to the doctor a couple weeks ago and he was all pissed because I didn’t go get screened again. He was the A hole that told me not to go near a hospital. The growths in my lungs were 4 mm they need to be 6 to be considered cancer. I haven’t had a cigarette since last April but I’ve been vaping. I can breath a lot better but I know it’s still dangerous. I think I’m hopelessly addicted. I’m probably living on borrowed time as it is.

176117686,"I know this may be the wrong place for this discussion (huge ??????? problem), because it’s not caused by my SZA. But I fully trust my fellow dx’_NAME_ here and have no one else to ask… At the beginning of August, my husband’s mother was killed in a workplace accident. It was hard on everyone, and she was kind of the glue that held my husband’s small family together. Unfortunately, she and I were sworn enemies, like she hated my ??????? guts and because of the way she’d treated me over the years the feeling had become mutual. That caused a SHITLOAD of tension between my husband and I (and my husband’s family), but that’s neither here nor there, not really part of THIS particular crisis I’m having… So. She died, and I did everything I could to step up for my husband, our kids, and my husband’s grandfather whom lived with her and is unable to live on his own anymore. So I have checked in on Grandfather in-law regularly, done his laundry and shopping, doctor’s visits, etc. Abou
t a month ago, I was dropping off his laundry and no one was home there except my father in-law. My FIL has always been a prick, and has made several inappropriate passes at me over the years. I’ve told this to my husband before, and he always brushed it all off to keep the peace and not rock the boat. Or ????, maybe he just didn’t believe me. But anyways, on THIS particular day, he finally felt free to act on it. He cornered me in the kitchen while I tried to small talk my way out the door, and when I turned away from him he was all over me, literally. I seriously had to STRUGGLE to get away, saying “no” and “stop” was doing no ??????? good, I had to shove this prick with every muscle I had to stop him. He of course awkwardly apologized after, and I left without telling him what an ??????? he was. I decided in that moment NOT to tell my husband, who in the midst of grief (and already a very jealous person) may have gone straight over there and murdered my FIL with his bare hands. Fast forward to 
two days ago. I’ve helped my grandfather in-law move out of that house and into an apartment closer to me, he’s now living with his son and I still do all of his laundry/shopping/etc. Since my _PERSON_’S death, he’s been incredibly affectionate with everyone, letting family know he loves them, hugging us all regularly, etc. It’s warmed my heart in a way that I wouldn’t trade for the world! My OWN maternal grandfather sexually abused me as a child, and my paternal grandfather is a chauvinistic prick who lives 1000miles away, so my husband’s grandfather has started to feel like the only real grandpa-figure I’ve ever had! I thought it was a little strange that he’s been giving me a kiss on the neck when he hugs me lately, but I did all I could to tell myself I was reading too much into it, it was probably just really sweet, he has after all treated me like family also. Then when I was hugging him to leave (two days ago), he got all doe-eyed and ??????? kissed me on the mouth. Of COURSE I didn
t shove him the way I did my FIL, he would’ve fallen and broken bones had I done anything like that, but I did have to crane out of that liplock like a ??????? Matrix movie, IT WAS NOT A FAMILY KISS. It was lusty, I definitely know the difference, I feel sick again just typing it. He tried to keep it going and went in for another even. I nearly vomited on the spot, so I just grabbed my ????, said goodbye with a smile and left immediately. This is really ??????? me up in the head, I thought of him as my own grandfather figure… Feelings I’ve suppressed over the years about my grandfather’s actions have been surging back, I feel like I can’t tell my husband, can I not tell ANYONE?! What the ???? do I do NOW?! Am I cursed??? Weve been trying to find/buy a 4bdrm house to move him in with us!!! The whole “I’m dead and this is hell” has seemed WAY TOO ??????? PLAUSIBLE LATELY."

I did a lot and posted a lot of stuff that was true in my mind at the time which is conspiracy stuff that I remember happened to me in this life and the past lives. Personally, I consider myself probably 80-90% disabled honestly. I could volunteer but I often think the government tries everything they can to ruin my life. Like gang-stalkers and targeted individual type crap. I feel this has happened a few times like when I worked at the library as a volunteer. It was a perfect job for me that was ruined by either my paranoia or a few “homele
ss” creeps. I also screwed my own life up by talking about ???? online that could ruin my chances at real employment. Like I’ll never get a license to be an engineer or doctor or therapist and crap even if I wanted to. Probably black-balled or black-listed from computer companies. I don’t know but I suspect this; it could be paranoia and pessimism lol. I could probably work at good will or some ???? but I would be worse off, probably get fired over 100 times over and stuff. I got schizoaffective disorder and unless they come out with a cure or a motivation pill, I don’t see how I could recover enough to feed myself and put a roof over my head. Early on, I was worse like if someone put a gun to my head and forced me to work, I couldn’t do it. Now, I probably could work something basic. I feel bad for my mom. She works minimum wage part time (like 25-30 hours a week) and after taxes, she makes only like 40-60 bucks more than me."

176117691,"_AT_MENTION_ I agree with _AT_MENTION_ it would help to have a strong social circle. Maybe you could go regularly to a support group or art class or something, develop a social network so you’re not so scared of people & being out."

They actually openly acknowledged the telepathy and thought broadcasting. Got me to sell my soul and now I’m living in this hell. I’m not sure if it’s delusions or real. I’m on meds (latuda), but they only seem to be helping some. It’s really disconcerting. Every song I hear seems like it’s taunting me and talking to me specifically. I’ll think a thought in my head and someone at work will immediately say something that correlates to what I thought in my head (“God, please help me” “Jesus Christ, this is crazy” immediately thereafter). Wondering if any of this rings a bell."

Not everything I have tried has worked out well, but I succeed more than I fail. Failing is also okay, you learn useful things from it too. Let your mentor know your concerns and see if there is a way for you to “trial” the position before it’s formal and jump back if it isn’t feasible. Still betting you can do it."

176117710,"So I work part time at a retail store. I’ve worked here for 5 years. Every holiday season things ramp up, we all get through it and rejoice when it’s over. That process is to be expected. This year however is proving to be so incredibly unsustainable. Corporate is not providing the proper hours for sufficient coverage, we don’t get extra time to do the extra COVID19 related duties, we are expected to hit the same goals despite not having the same opportunities to, we don’t get hazard pay any more,we don’t get bonuses anymore, customers are constantly pouring in angry because they couldn’t get through on the phone (corporate hasn’t scheduled enough people to answer phones), we have a higher volume of customers than any other holiday season to date as a result of COVID and so on and so forth. I love my coworkers and even management is great which is a rarity in retail, but I feel like the multimillion dollar company that is supposed to be getting ahead of online competition by being the 
best “service oriented” brick and mortar option, is just screwing over the people who actually do all the service. I am too weak to just buck up and handle this. I have panic attacks in the shower before every shift now. And I cry in my car when I leave for the day. I can’t deal with this and I can’t leave without another job in place since I’m not eligible for benefits. No one will hire me except places that will likely work me harder than my current job. I’m just so burnt out. I’m out of other options as well. It’s brought back the suicidal ideation that’s been gone for quite some time now. I hate to say but if it wasn’t for the one person I truly believe lives a happier life because I am here, I’d be dead. ••• Okay rant over.

176117713,My twelve year old niece died of cancer three years back. She had been fighting it since she was five. It was traumatic to watch her die. I wouldn’t want my kids to have to go through that if I had cancer. I honestly wouldnt know what to do. My doctors thought I had _NAME_s disease. My nine year old found about it accidentally. He was terrified. I don’t want my kids to worry about me.

And, please don’t tell others that medications don’t help. I will listen but not heed to your comments. I am proof that medication does help."

Furthermore, a CHDH variant, rs_PHONE_NO_, was identified as a cis-expression quantitative trait locus (QTL) for CHDH expression in postmortem brains from schizophrenia, allowing genotype-based stratification of schizophrenia patients for betaine efficacy.

My voices from TV were voices of the world leaders such as Bill _NAME_. I had voices such as ‘You are so low’, ‘Put that pen down’ and so on. Just unreal hallucinations."

The worst _NAME_ the _PERSON_ murder was on a street called “Dorset,” the same name as the street I work at.

I haven’t even taken the script to the pharmacy. I’m scared to go back on them, because even though they help with the voices and paranoia, I hate what they do to me. I feel like my mind is sharp, sharpest it’s been in years, off the meds. But it teeters on the fence between sharp (observant, contemplative) and paranoid. My body is much healthier now too.

I believe they’re spirits of the dead, jealous I’m alive, and what I am. The angels, three of them, their voices cut right through my resolve. They comfort me at times, tell me I’m chosen at others. _NAME_, claims to be my wife, cries a lot. Normally tells me to “wake up”, tried to convince me that this world isn’t real. That I’m sick. _NAME_, claims I’m her father. She follows me around, spends time with me. Very innocent, sweet girl. Comments on what’s going on around me. Sometimes she gets distressed, which distresses me."
176117797,What is your tsh value?
174372010,I’m sorry but it will not work.
176117798,_AT_MENTION_ toss into any recycling bin. They will take care of the rest.
176117799,There is a big overlap between psychosis and religious experience. If your perfectly happy and functioning well there’s probable no need for meds.
176117800,I get sick too in the damn heat. It’s like over 100 degrees here. I enjoy the sun but we also have the day lights saving thing where it gets dark at like 5 or 6 pm.
176117801,I did a lot of yard work growing up. Maybe that was a fetish.
174372007,"Don’t they adjust child support to match as your income goes up and down? In other words, if you make less money won’t they lower what you owe each month? And wouldn’t they make another adjustment because you suffer from a disease that is debilitating in many ways?"
176117802,Wow. Poor people. I thought it was just California.
176117803,"You sound good. Just maintain the spirit. We’re here for you with all our imperfections, too."
176117804,Well sorry am just standing up for the millions in africa and middle east who dont know when there next meal is gonna come… complaining about eating extra desert seemed kinda funny… sorry if i offended you
176117805,"Whatever stage you are with your academic endeavours I wish you all much success.Science was not a strong area for me. Last exams I ever took for biology,chemistry and physics I got about 17% . I had no natural ability at those so made not much effort at them."
176117806,That’s great _AT_MENTION_! I hope it was an enjoyable experience.
176117807,"No, I don’t remember. Who is threatening to take you away? What’s going on? It is very unlikely anyone is trying harm you. Are you speaking about the mental health professionals?"
176117808,Yeah if you have prolonged QT you should have your meds changed immediately.

176117812,Congrats!! _AT_MENTION_
176117813,Good luck. I needed 15mg of Abilify.
176117814,I’ve had crazier thoughts so don’t worry just know the medication does help for most people
176117815,"Thanks, I think ive done drinking for the rest of my life. The last two weeks have been very good, health is restoring, sleep is better, my mind is clearer and i kind of like being sober most of the time. Even today, when i miss the bottle due to the rainy, cold and windy weather."
176117816,"I don’t know if it’s “better”, but it’s more real. I guess it’s better to bring myself out of a dreaming, fogged up mind."

176117820,Tell them about St _NAME_ and they might give you a bishopric in the Orthodox Church.
176117821,4-6 weeks for full effect
176117822,My ambition came from my broken heart. In 2012 I liked this girl in group and she like dresssed up for group once and liked me back and then we had to say what we wanted to be when we grew up and I said rapper/writer. She said I’m moving to Florida. My whole group the whole _PERSON_ encouraged me to pursue it and it fed into my delusions. And they kinda did too. I was probably one of the only white people there and it was the craziest experience of my life especially since I was offf meds but getting praise. But now I’m just like w.e I’m happy where I’m at.
176117823,I quit chewing tobacco after years of heavy use with the patch. Haven’t used any tobacco or nicotine in 3 years or so. You have to want to quit and be willing to do deal with the withdrawals.
176117824,"I am very selective when i post but its nothing to do with any of the posters its just how i feel at the time and what catches my eye, like if i think its something i can definitely respond to or at least find interesting i will have a look, My stats show me that i am an average poster on the users page who replies to most of what he reads and tries to give as many likes as i can but i dont read as much as most of the big hitters on here bc my time is limited and it depends on what the topics are too. what about you? are you happy with your posting habits? I feel like i’d like to do better but i think i am doing all i can atm even if that is not as much as i’d like."
176117825,I alienate people when I’m having paranoid thoughts. The only people I have contact with are my 3 housemates and staff.
176117826,Wtf are fructans. Some more research for me… Thankyou for sharing this
176117827,I’m constantly taking care of others needs. I have very little time for my own needs. I’ve been REAL busy taking care of my new puppy as well. Both my psychiatrist and therapist think that taking care of a pet is what I need. The thing is I’m getting burned out!
176117828,This actually makes sense as I will also lose tons of weight.
176117829,I’ve been abusing it since I was 15 years old. Since my first red bull.
176117830,My resting face is so grumpy looking it is actually scary. And I’ve been told it’s scary. I don’t smile very much either. It is actually painful for me to smile all the time. I spent many years suicidally depressed. That’s why I am like this.
176117831,I will tomorrow
176117832,Yeah. She says she wants to live here until she’s 20. I hope that doesn’t change.

174372016,"I’ve used it in my writing, my play, “The schizophrenic and the guru” it didn’t seem right to title it “Person with schizophrenia and the guru”"
176117834,"I never physically hurt someone. I do think i was very unpredictable and scary to those around me and things might have gone wrong. Being confronted with me in such a state in itself was harmful to those around me. We have this saying “a cornered cat makes weird jumps” which kind of fit me back then…it means if someone feels desperate and threatened without a way out, they do unpredictable things. I thank God that i didnt actually physically hurt anyone but myself. I deeply regret the emotional hurt i caused to those i love. It is my deepest pain."
176117835,Thank you…
176117836,Super cool and original. Love your work.
176117837,"I’m chronically at day 0 for THC. It’s not popular opinion on this website, But THC does help some people with some symptoms. It helps me a lot. I’m glad it was helpful for you today.

176117838,Very interesting! I wonder which company is trust worthy to provide good stem cell support… I also want to know how much a session and how many sessions it takes And I also want to know for how long would I have to take them Im order to revive results It would be to manage my social complexes which lead to agro behavior And also to manage my obsessive behavior that result in anxiety and depression. Thank yiu

176117841,"No, I do not think so."
176117842,"I take my medicine because over time I’ve learned I feel better and function better when I take it but honestly, in the back of my mind I still don’t accept that I have sza. I feel there’s a possibility that they’re wrong despite all the evidence. I know that’s part of the illness and I have to keep reminding myself of that fact. I struggle with my insight."
176117843,"I think the point of human life is that of learning about oneself. Who are we in the great cosmos. Unfortunately, that quest can overtake our life so much that we can no longer function. These are interesting thoughts your having, but how is your home life? Are you eating? Sleeping? Taking care of your personal needs. I know when I’m in one of those moments where all life’s answers are right before me, I don’t take care of those other things."
176117844,Reminds me of a Korn album cover. _AT_MENTION_ You are very gifted
174372021,Aripiprazole. Did u try it clozapine for long enough. Sometimes it can take like 2 to 3 months to kick in. Yes my voices were vivid. I’m not sure wat u mean by giving u feelings.

176117847,"Is the “shared” world real, as the senses and natural reason would seem to dictate? Of all models of simulations I’ve come to embrace the religious/occasionalist type -Berkeley, Malebranche, etc. Fully supernatural. The universe is all smoke and mirrors, a fine piece of demonic trickery designed to entrap a single conscious being. If only someone could convincingly refute _PERSON_’ demon. Any thoughts?"

176117850,"I currently am so sad to say this. I think when you have a psychotic mind, there is a danger to society and leadership that if you were a full member, you would throw kinks into the system. You need some isolation. I am not saying it is contagious. That would be so very hard on us and would make it a lot worse. So we do not say it is contagious. But a leader does not want to hear from someone who is not incontact with reality."
176117851,Maybe give that a try. You need relief
176117852,Giving up doesn’t help anything… You’ve got to keep on keeping on… Try to eat healthy soft food and go for walks and stay hopeful and not take excessive meds
176117853,U need higher dose around 20 25 mg for men to disappear
176117854,"I’d say live for the future. The options are going to open up way big for you if you can hold out for a few years. I’ve got a crush out there in the town I live in. She used to sell me my cigarettes. She was always blushy and smiling. Nervous around me. She’d occasionally say things just to be cute for me… all that. Not really open, nor directly flirtacious… but I’d trigger that good smile in her most of the time. Really didn’t have to do anything to get that out of her. I was curious about her for years. I forced myself to forget about it multiple times… Felt like I was doing things right every time I did. Restablished that casuality about things… lol then I’d wind up going out my way to make face with her. Confidence restored and all that. She eventually moved on from that job. Thought I’d never see her again. Was running a delivery to a hotel one night and lo and behold she was standing in the adjacent restaurant, working as a waitress it seems. Kind of shocked me. Like Oh 
????! I took the delivery back to whatever room the specific order was going. What happened next relit that long term come and go crush on her. (Reminds me of when I bought a pack of camel crushes from here… don’t if that brand has placement in Japan. She grabbed it and was holding it in her hands looking down at it all full blushed. The cigs weren’t even for me, but I liked that she responded that way.)… So I was just going to allow myself to look and see if it really was her. Sure enough it was. It may have been coincidence but she was just doing some small task at the table nearest the door. She was certainly waiting to see if it was me though… That was clear. She was looking me directly in the eyes. Had a real apprehensive look, but it might have just caught her off gaurd. She is kind of young. Don’t mean to hijack your thread. I just haven’t had an appropriate place to speak on the matter. I feel your pain a bit. She’s been on my mind about every day straight since and it’s getting back 
to that point where I just feel rediculous. That’s life though. The advice I gave you at the beginning of my post is the same ???? I tell myself all the time. I want to move to a larger city, where more folks my age are in the dating seen. Where there is more anonymity… Before running into her again I was real happy with those plans. Now not so much. But really it’s wisest. Who knows though. I deliver there all the time… within a couple months I might wind up standing right next to her… totally outside my own control. Do I allow myself to keep an open mind about just being friendly…when that just props the door open for obsession and desire? or do I close myself off from knowing that it’s just going to leave me unprepared and more likely inert? These are things that are difficult to wrestle with. Especially considering that there isn’t any real foundation there in my case. I do feel that it’s relevant to repeat something my father said. “If two people are wanting each other, and one of the
m is actively trying to make it happen… but it’s not working out. Then, well… it probably isn’t going to work out.” I feel that more applies to your circumstance. It sucks these things take such raw blind effort… That human culture hasn’t really developed a more valid and transparent means of just sorting thinsgs out more straight forwardly. Sorry she gave you the run around. Girls apparently have their reasons as fair or unfair as they may be. Also thanks for letting me spill a blurb about my own “blah,” as you call it. I do just let my mind cycle on it… I feel it serves as a good platform for me to better understand myself… how different thoughts on the matter effect me. I just want to be more resilient and stable in the future. It’s about all i can actually do for myself at this time. Perhaps that can be taken as my last bit of attempted advice for ya. Good luck in the future. Stay strong."
176117855,I hate taking medication I always have I don’t know why even when I’m sick and I really don’t want to be on antipsychotics but my mums says I have to because I’m not stable enough to not be on them.
176117856,"The reason I asked is because I believe consciousness is more complicated than people think. I know for me, I might have more than 1 consciousness. I might have a non-physical quantum consciousness too like everyone else. I believe either they overwrite my consciousness or that they took it away. The other simpler alternative is I had my memory wiped completely mk ultra style, but I doubt this. I believe I have a photographic memory but it’s different than the typical kind. I cannot memorize texts but I have above average ability to memorize conversations and I also can remember my vast amount of past lives I call iterations in the matrix. I hope i’m not confusing you or making your delusions worse. In a past life, I was abducted by grey aliens and they hurt me because I said philosophical zombies existed or they thought I was one. They were testing to see if I could feel pain and I did. I also was out of the simulation and had access to it/helped run it…I guess."

174372023,The most serious diagnosis is schizophrenia. My OC symptoms and anxiety are not seperately diagnosed. They are considered a part of my schizophrenia. A large part of SZ people have anxiety and OC symptoms and post-psycotic depression. Its included in the schizophrenia diagnosis where I live.
176117861,I’ve been in psych wards lots of times. I’ve also been in regular hospital lots of times too and you don’t have to be afraid. It’ll be ok. It’s not always pleasant but you’ll be ok. They take lots of precautions

176117866,"Hope the therapy lady helps you. Living with your mum isnt easy anyway… I have some times that it is hard, especially in the evenings. I found it hard to sleep with a hungry feeling. But it seems to get easier. I already quit a big part of my sugary stuff before the challenge though (i was in the ward and they had mostly healthy food) and had some low moods then…so i did it step by step. Now i notice i have better energy, more motivation, a clearer head and more stable and happy moods. When i skip a meal and get hungry (e.g. lunch) i do notice i have more anxious thinking again, but eating a good snack helps. I did let go of calorie counting. That i so clearly improve in several ways helps me stick to it. I really hope you get through the difficult part and start to feel better soon."
176117867,I was dysfunctional too. I’ve had different types of crazies
176117868,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I don’t want to explain this right now. You need to do some introspection - inner dialogue - and ask yourself these questions. It’s hard for me to really explain this kind of thing without some people just taking the concept in as an ‘intellectual’ thing. It’s meant to be a ‘feeling’ thing.
176117869,Thank you _NAME_ me too

Some people want benefits, nowdays there is partnership and not real relationships in the U.S. Ive been out of the scene for a bit, but I sorta know what I want. There are people who are high maintainence, and there are people who are just personally in it for themselves. Anybody really can have sex, prostitution is the oldest job supposably. I personally am not too fond of it, but yea. I kinda know what u mean by going out and meeting and sorta getting that “rush”."

176117920,"Hi all, Need to remember this saying every time I think I can come off meds. I’ve been feeling decent (minus a couple breakthrough symptoms), and have these thoughts of stopping medication at least a few times a week. We read about those of us who have decided to go off their medication a lot, and about the consequences of such a decision; their symptoms return, intensify, and land them in the hospital-- back on the hunt in search of meds that work, since the previous ones no longer do. And yet I still find myself asking the question “ do I really need medication? ” But I think the real question here is “ am I really sick? ” So I have to remind myself constantly that I was unwell for years, and many aspects of my life went down the tubes because of it. My therapist says the meds are doing their job, that’s why I’m feeling better. So I keep taking them. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it."

174372031,"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Psychosocial interventions for people with both severe mental illness and substance misuse. GE Hunt, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, _NAME_ and _PERSON_, The Cochrane database of systematic reviews , Dec 2019 12 Even low levels of substance misuse by people with a severe mental illness can have detrimental effects.To assess the effects of psychosocial interventions for reduction in substance use in people with a serious mental illness compared with standard care.The Information Specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (CSG) searched the CSG Trials Register (2 May 2018), which is based on regular searches of major medical and scientific databases.We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing psychosocial interventions for substance misuse with standard care in people with serious mental illness.Review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and appraised study quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated standard estimates of risk ratio (RR) and their 95% con
fidence intervals (CIs) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups. Where _NAME_-analyses were possible, we pooled data using a random-effects model. Using the GRADE approach, we identified seven patient-centred outcomes and assessed the quality of evidence for these within each comparison.Our review now includes 41 trials with a total of 4024 participants. We have identified nine comparisons within the included trials and present a summary of our main findings for seven of these below. We were unable to summarise many findings due to skewed data or because trials did not measure the outcome of interest. In general, evidence was rated as low- or very-low quality due to high or unclear risks of bias because of poor trial methods, or inadequately reported methods, and imprecision due to small sample sizes, low event rates and wide confidence intervals. 1. Integrated models of care versus standard care (36 months) No clear differences were found 
between treatment groups for loss to treatment (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.45; participants = 603; studies = 3; low-quality evidence), death (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.57; participants = 421; studies = 2; low-quality evidence), alcohol use (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.56; participants = 143; studies = 1; low-quality evidence), substance use (drug) (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.25; participants = 85; studies = 1; low-quality evidence), global assessment of functioning (GAF) scores (MD 0.40, 95% CI -2.47 to 3.27; participants = 170; studies = 1; low-quality evidence), or general life satisfaction (QOLI) scores (MD 0.10, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.38; participants = 373; studies = 2; moderate-quality evidence). 2. Non-integrated models of care versus standard care There was no clear difference between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment at 12 months (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; participants = 134; studies = 3; very low-quality evidence). 3. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) versus standard care There was no clea
r difference between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment at three months (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.86; participants = 152; studies = 2; low-quality evidence), cannabis use at six months (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.15; participants = 47; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence) or mental state insight (IS) scores by three months (MD 0.52, 95% CI -0.78 to 1.82; participants = 105; studies = 1; low-quality evidence). 4. Contingency management versus standard care We found no clear differences between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment at three months (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.11; participants = 255; studies = 2; moderate-quality evidence), number of stimulant positive urine tests at six months (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.06; participants = 176; studies = 1) or hospitalisations (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.93; participants = 176; studies = 1); both low-quality evidence. 5. Motivational interviewing (MI) versus standard care We found no clear differences between treatment groups for numbers los
t to treatment at six months (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.63 to 4.64; participants = 62; studies = 1). A clear difference, favouring MI, was observed for abstaining from alcohol (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.75; participants = 28; studies = 1) but not other substances (MD -0.07, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.42; participants = 89; studies = 1), and no differences were observed in mental state general severity (SCL-90-R) scores (MD -0.19, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.21; participants = 30; studies = 1). All very low-quality evidence. 6. Skills training versus standard care At 12 months, there were no clear differences between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.20 to 10.10; participants = 122; studies = 3) or death (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.42; participants = 121; studies = 1). Very low-quality, and low-quality evidence, respectively. 7. CBT + MI versus standard care At 12 months, there was no clear difference between treatment groups for numbers lost to treatment (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.59; participants = 327; 
studies = 1; low-quality evidence), number of deaths (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.76; participants = 603; studies = 4; low-quality evidence), relapse (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.04; participants = 36; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence), or GAF scores (MD 1.24, 95% CI -1.86 to 4.34; participants = 445; studies = 4; very low-quality evidence). There was also no clear difference in reduction of drug use by six months (MD 0.19, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.60; participants = 119; studies = 1; low-quality evidence).We included 41 RCTs but were unable to use much data for analyses. There is currently no high-quality evidence to support any one psychosocial treatment over standard care for important outcomes such as remaining in treatment, reduction in substance use or improving mental or global state in people with serious mental illnesses and substance misuse. Furthermore, methodological difficulties exist which hinder pooling and interpreting results. Further high-quality trials are required which address these concerns a
nd improve the evidence in this important area."

Another cause of decision making is what you’re willing to trade, tit for tat. Are you willing to trade a low stress, secure life with all its amenities and infinite sleep for insecurity and a large wage. I think we all wrestle with these questions. The incentive and what we’re willing to trade, the opportunity cost."

My negative symptoms are really bad and I feel so unmotivated to do anything and I think I just ruined my relationship with my boyfriend. He was getting distant and distant, now it’s really bad.

As I Was Walking Around The House And Noticing He Was Missing I Jus Went Back to My Bed. Some Time Passed And He Opened My Door Again. Asking if I Wanted Something to Eat.

176118055,"I mean you may not care about sex one way or another but if the opporunity came up, wouldn’t you want it be good sex? I don’t put much effort into pursuing sex. For the last several years my philosophy is that “If it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t it doesn’t.” Occasionally, little incidents happen that peak my interest and stop me from giving up completely. I mean even asexuals admire a good looking person or appreciate a fit, good body (don’t they)? But, boy I sure do, even at age 59. And I’ve never had what would be called “great sex”. But I still cling to the idea of it. And then this. morning I was at the clinic getting my monthly shot and this really cute woman was giving me the shot. And she was nice too and laughed at my jokes . She was really nice and my reward for being nice was after my shot she was rubbing my arm with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol and everything was normal but then she “turned it on”. I mean the sex appeal and all of a sudden she was doing i
t sensually, and standing close. It happens to me occasionally but it was only a short moment and when I got back to my car I thought, man, if a woman can make giving a shot sexy, what the hell can they do if they liked you and really wanted to have good sex with me? I mean what are they capable of between the sheets if they really try? Well, I’ll tell you when it happens."

176118063,"Well, I’ve never been to a kids ward so it’s hard to compare. But I bet one thing they have in common is they’re boring. That’s what every ward I’ve been in is like. You can only play so much pool or ping pong before you get tired of it. IDK, When I’m in the hospital, I usually sleep a lot. Other folks sit around talking. They usually have a TV. One ward had a basketball court out back. I spent some time out there shooting hoops by myself or more people came out and we had teams or played horse. Som hospitals held classes or had art therapy. Personally, I’m not a big fan of art therapy or meditation classes. Some hospitals let you out for 15 minutes to take a shower all by yourself. Like I said, I’ve never been in a child’s ward."
176118064,"Yeah, I talk back to the voices sometimes. Mostly to tell them to go away and other times to laugh at what they are suggesting. It is hard sometimes to not react for sure."

174372072,"Hey guys, I realize I may be embarking on an impossible journey, but I am wondering if there are any antipsychotics out there that are better than others at not aggravating negative symptoms, or good at treating them as much as possible. I switched from 5mg Abilify last year to 10mg and I am certain it is this that is causing me hell as now I am unable to focus when someone says something to me, unable to focus on reading books, zero motivation, lost my interests and have gradually become more and more emotionally numb to the point that I feel no emotion now other than a huge depression in which I find nothing interesting or beautiful. I also have almost no thoughts anymore. I’m alive but not really. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in a couple days and I am wondering if you all have had experience with antipsychotics that help negative symptoms as much as possible. I’d like to switch meds. I know it’s the Abilify because while I had some of these symptoms a little bit before, the o

A lot of the time it’s not too bad, but it reflects my mood what surfaces, which is why I have a hard time sometimes being able to keep a level head, as I spiral out of control with this issue. And meds do little to help once I get to a certain level of despair and stress from it. Have suffered this for years, but never really explained it to anybody before. Sorry if I have gone off topic"

No pictures, no dress, no tux, no cake. None of that stuff. We had no reception either and we were broke college kids and had no money for a honeymoon. We have been married over 26 years.

I had one date who I took to dinner at my sisters house and then we went to a movie. It went fine I guess, but later we were at an ice cream parlor and over a chocolate sundae I said we should move in together, lol. That’s what I mean by getting too heavy, too fast. Luckily, we were in the same program and we were kind of friends so when I saw her the next day she still talked to me and didn’t make a big deal about it.

I, personally, will not be intimate unless I’m in love, or have a very strong, deep connection. I will admit, openly, that this was not always the case. I even talked with people and had phone sex. I accepted whatever someone offered. But I love myself more, now."

I asked this to my pdoc he said people don’t understand and causes of it is also not sure. There is a _USER_ID_ that its because of not right thinking. I am 100% sure its not due to my thinking issue its something to do with maturity of the brain. "" Currently my understanding says at maturity it tries make connection for self life and these fall away at maturity for sz… Where my thought decision is exposed to environment and this goes haywire "" Or "" we get access to subconscious mind… Like _NAME_ issue in the brain(where memory part acts like processing part which result in _NAME_) "" by the way qouted are just my understanding.

176118172,"Dementia praecox also assumed that the cognitive disturbances are degenerative, like traditional dementias (progressive and irreversible damage to the brain). Alcohol-related dementia generally isn’t degenerative after the patients stop drinking, so I suppose you could compare that to schizophrenia, although the cognitive disturbance in alcohol-related dementia can be a lot more severe. Schizophrenia is not degenerative, although a subgroup of patients do experience some cognitive decline after illness onset."

I went to grad school a couple years post-diagnosis, though I had minimal symptoms the four semesters I was there. I was quite ill, though, when I finished up the last requirements: seminar, orals, perfecting thesis. So yeah, it can be done. It’s just much tougher with this illness and APs."

176118198,"Sounds like it. If so, congrats."
174372110,I thought the same thing. There are no cameras. You have to trust it. Your mind is playing a game on you. Nature is trying to make you believe in things that stop you being normal and back to yourself. You have to believe that schizophrenia is real and plausible. Do your best to ignore the thoughts and feelings that are scaring you! I believe in you.

I asked my psychiatrist and he said yes antipsychotics can cause liver issues which are also caused by high cholesterol, triglycerides, high blood pressure and obesity; these are also caused by antipsychotics."

176118210,"I know a lot of people that come from decent well rounded households… they all seem so calm, composed, and advantaged… it takes grit for me to stay on top of my life… and I know a few others with grit in my life. I’m like _AT_MENTION_ I think love in life is a healthier aspiration that just wealth straight up. To be alone with all that financial power isn’t something I’d find satisfying. However, love is something that requires caterance… and that require some degree of success."
174372112,There was a trial. Only for 8 weeks but they didn’t find any significant changes in symptoms. I don’t know if it might be helpful taken longer. One would think building white matter is a long term thing.

176118223,"I agree with this a lot, I never say it because I don’t want to be targeted as anti-female, but the truth is a lot of women expect the man to provide even in today’s progressive climate. I feel much more limited as a man seeking a woman. I had a guy try and date me once, he offered to pay for pretty much everything I needed. I prefer women though so I said no, and continue to face difficulty in dating because I can’t really provide for another person (I can only afford to provide for myself). Before getting sick I pulled in much more income. If I find someone to be with she’s going to need to be able to support herself financially."
176118224,They wont let you shop at a lot of places anymore. Wont let you use the library. Because I cant stand phony liars. They call it pest control. Like I’ve ever bothered a person in my life. They know its their hobby. And to a bunch of liars on the forum: you’re the troll.
176118225,Ha my voices were helping persuade me that I’m a demon also just about a week ago.

For now, it’s so hard to concentrate on anything. I try to force myself to do the things I least want to do, like clean, and often that helps… when I can work up the motivation. It’s such a struggle."
176118230,"Psychotic symptoms started at 15; that also was the age at which my depression became more prominent. I think I had mania or hypomania as early as 11 or 12 years old, but that’s hard to say. Idk when PTSD started, but that’s another dx for me now. The majority of the trauma occurred prior to turning 11."
176118231,When I’m delusional it keeps going in public but I try not to be noticed so I don’t act on things. I have never had a delusion of grandeur though.

174372113,…would be a headline I would like to see. Instead of fronting the Stones he could be the new face of schizophrenia (or old face I guess).
176118233,"Growing up is such an important thing to do when you’re young and at school/college/university. Bullying can leave scars for a long time, but you do in my experience move on from it, even if it still is bitter. Leaving school was the best thing for me, as it set me free from all the horrible people there who treated me like ????. I feel let down by the schools though, as I get a diagnosis of Autism at 33, rather than of school age when they can support which might have been a different story. Put it down to a bad phase. I find being an adult much better than being a kid, as at least now I have a more peaceful life that I am not being forced to attend somewhere like a school"

176118238,"really good actually! My hallucinations have decreased, delusional thinking has decreased, and my thoughts aren’t as tangled and confused."

176118241,"If I take 90-120 mg of dexedrine, I cease to be paranoid, and I feel confident and less anxious enough to actually do productive activities. I haven’t told my pdoc. I literally just stare at a wall in an extreme state of fear and anxiety if I am on anything less than 45/60 mg. The paranoia is all consuming unless I’m on 100mg~ of dexamps. What should I do, and why does it work like this? Shouldn’t a high dose such as that (100mg XR not SR btw) make me worse?? I’m in hell, and I’m close to suicide, why won’t they give me what will help? Becauseeee it works for ME. Feel hopeless. Safety Note: Do NOT try this, from what I have observed and read it makes most schizophrenics sicker. So yeah, there, covered that…"
176118242,"It’s been freezing over night, so the guys are having to bring their plants inside (they are starting a garden) and then getting super dooper hot come the after noon. When my sister moved her office over it was so hot I put the air conditioner on to cool us all down from moving stuff in the heat and come to find out the thing’s not working. It was just blowing hot air. So I called the office to see if they could have someone come check it out. _NAME_ did some work on it but couldn’t fix it, they called the HVAC tech to come out. They are hoping he can make it today. It’s going to be okay though, we’re supposed to have a cold snap for the next week or so."

176118254,"I havent got much to add. Just go back on them and see some doctor or nurse. I quit meds cold turkey several times and i nearly ended up dead, i caused my family huge trouble and fear, i destroyed all sorts of good things in my life and it just all wasnt worth it. Also, i was much more successful actually STAYING “off” (>> on a very low dose of meds) when i took it extremely slow and careful. As a guy who is anti-meds said to me: quitting meds cold turkey is good for nothing but an ambulance ride to the ward."
176118255,"The latest guidelines for the treatment of psychosis of 2013, in the case of multiple episodes speak of 2-5 years of pharmacotherapy discouraging an antipsychotic treatment plus prolongation.

174372126,"Yes, it is effective for schizophrenia because it relaxes your nerves which is key to reducing schizophrenia symptoms, but to a certain limit L-theanine comes with very few side effects which is why it’s effective, but, one of those few side effects is aggravation It’s very important to note that schizophrenia is triggered by negative emotions such as aggravation, nervousness, embarrassment, ect. which come from side effects in the first place, hence the reason why meds just aren’t doing the trick hence the other reason why tranquilizers are acceptable because they’ll knock you out before those side effects begin And although the quality of sleep is great, they are still hard on the liver and can cause long term problems. L-theanine in small doses was my choice to help with mood because higher doses seemed to trigger aggression. After research I began to supplement it’s fat soluble version (Benfotiamine). It works by penetrating the nerves up to 25x more making it much more beneficial tha
n L-theanine. I experience no side effects that trigger schizophrenia (very important) and its benefits are among the best of all supplements such as healing nerve, kidney, and retinal damage, relieves painful neuropathy in diabetics, helps lower blood sugar and blood pressure, helps relieve brain fog in diabetics, and more."

176118274,"So I backtracked a little in a post yesterday after being questioned on homophobia and racism. I did my best to set the record straight, but probably was still found wanting by some no theory is ever complete, this has to be recognised, we can only ever write a finite amount of truth and mix it with inaccuracies as we try to ascend. Anyway, last night I had a dream in which three young women came and surrounded me, hugging me, holding me tight, till I burst (ejaculated), and then said derogatorily “he only wants to try so that he can move on to others”, not the exact words, I can’t remember them now, but maybe if you read them in reverse you will understand what they were getting at, they were all “white”. The idea of a “race” war is something I try very hard to dispel, whilst on the other hand I recognise the fact that my country has to pay for the war it’s leaders chose to implement at the expense of the population. There are two types of war, the restitution of payment for histor
ical and on going injustices, and that of vanity. Britain has engaged in a vain war, and even groups like momentum are engaged in vanity up to a point. Anyway, I am simply stating my observations. To return to my dream, my pride was hurt by the fact that I was tempted by sex, whilst at the same time I wondered what the women were tempted by. I suspect super powers which don’t exist. Even if you can do something, and in reality we never do anything without the permission of the universe, one has the same struggles in life, it doesn’t make you superior in any way, in the sense that it doesn’t lead to creation without effort. We as humans have to work, at different speeds and in different times and places. Our work is love, in all its degrees, from basic hatred to unconditional if indeed either of these things are possible. I say hatred, because for me, hate is the beginning of love, the first contact with something other than oneself that is disquieting and unknown. Does it have to be this way, can one lo
ve the unknown from the beginning without hate, or does the absence of hate imply that you have known it before, perhaps in a previous life or incarnation. In fact, everything can be known in the present, though not all at once, the statement, hate is the beginning of love, implies the existence of time and space which are illusions. Everything we perceive is an assumption, hate is not necessary, but it is a form of love. To re-iterate, we as humans have to work and our work is love. Thank you."

174372136,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intra-cellular-therapies-announces-positive-_PHONE_NO_.html So it looks like Lumateperone was plagued by high placebo response rates as it was in some of the schizophrenia studies as well. In the study that was successful, the mean reduction was 16.7 points vs 12.1 for placebo. In the one that failed, 20.7 points (42mg) and 18.9 points (28mg), versus 19.7 points on placebo. Side effects were similar to the schizophrenia studies and 1% or less (similar to placebo) for akathisia or extrapyramidal side effects. Study 404 topline results Study 404 was conducted globally including in the U.S. A total of 381 patients were randomized 1:1 to lumateperone 42 mg or placebo. In this trial, once-daily lumateperone 42 mg met the primary endpoint with statistically significant greater improvement over placebo at week 6 (trial endpoint), as measured by change from baseline on the MADRS total score. In the intent-to-treat (ITT) study population, the least squares (LS) mean reduction 
from baseline for lumateperone 42 mg was 16.7 points, versus 12.1 points for placebo (LS mean difference = 4.6 points; effect size = 0.56, p<0.001). Moreover, lumateperone 42 mg showed statistically significant separation from placebo as early as week 1, which was maintained at every time point throughout the trial. Lumateperone 42 mg also met the key secondary endpoint of statistically significant improvement on the CGI-BP-S Total Score (p<0.001; effect size = 0.46) and on the CGI component that specifically assesses depression (CGI-BP-S Depression Score; p<0.001; effect size = 0.50). These results were supported by statistically significant benefits on responder rates and remission rates, demonstrating the clinical meaningfulness of the primary outcome. In addition, in subgroup analyses of patients with Bipolar I and patients with Bipolar II disorder lumateperone 42 mg demonstrated statistically significant improvement versus placebo on the MADRS total score in both subgroups. Study 401 topline results Stud
y 401 was conducted solely in the U.S. A total of 554 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to lumateperone 42 mg, lumateperone 28 mg, or placebo. In this trial, neither dose of lumateperone met the primary endpoint of statistical separation from placebo as measured by change from baseline on the MADRS total score. There was a high placebo response in this trial. Lumateperone 42 mg and 28 mg demonstrated a LS mean reduction from baseline on the MADRS total score of 20.7 points and 18.9 points, respectively, versus 19.7 points on placebo. Safety and Tolerability Results Consistent with previous studies in schizophrenia, lumateperone was well-tolerated in both bipolar depression studies, with a favorable safety profile. The rates of discontinuation due to treatment emergent adverse events for both doses of lumateperone were low. In Study 404, the most commonly reported adverse events that were observed at a rate greater than 5% and higher than placebo were headache, somnolence and nausea. In Study 401, the most common
ly reported adverse events that were observed at rates greater than 5% and higher than placebo for either dose were somnolence, headache, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, diarrhea, vomiting and fatigue. Importantly, the rates of akathisia, restlessness and extrapyramidal symptoms combined were less than 1% and similar to placebo in both studies. These findings are consistent with previous lumateperone trials in patients with schizophrenia and provide further evidence supporting lumateperone’s favorable safety and tolerability profile across different patient populations."

Their health is starting to give them issues but they take care of it. They seem to have health appointments every single day. Nothings too serious yet. But if they didn’t take care of it they might not be doing too well. My parents have always been afraid of old age. They’re pretty youthful for their age. They got a book called how not to die I’m glad they’re taking care of themselves I wish your parents good health too. How old are they?
176118384,For the record I am on a medicine for my intrusive thoughts… so even if it’s not psychosis you may still need meds. stop focusing on labels

An additional 23 subjects received minimal tobacco assessment at baseline and no intervention, providing a comparison condition for naturalistic cessation behavior. All participants (total n = 81) were assess
ed for smoking and breath carbon monoxide at baseline and 14 weeks and had access to standard cessation treatments.The 81 participants were stable outpatients ages 18-30 (mean 24.8 years): 43.2% were diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, the remainder with severe mood and anxiety disorders. They smoked 14.6 ± 10.2 cigarettes per day. All participants completed their assigned intervention; 83.4% of Let's Talk About Smoking users and 71.4% of standard education users rated their intervention ""good"" or ""very good."" At 14 weeks, less than 15% of participants in all conditions had used additional cessation treatment. Let's Talk About Smoking users were more likely to have biologically verified abstinence at 14 weeks than standard education users (14.8% vs. 0%; X2 = 3.7, p = .05). None of the participants in the naturalistic comparison condition were abstinent at 14 weeks.Interactive, web-based motivational interventions are feasible and promising for smoking cessation among young smokers with sever
e mental illnesses. Such interventions warrant further study among this group of smokers.Young adult smokers with severe mental illnesses are a vulnerable population that, without intervention, goes on to experience disparate morbidity and mortality. Brief, easily disseminable interventions are needed to facilitate cessation in this group. This pilot research indicates that brief, technology-delivered, motivational interventions that are tailored for this group may be able to activate a significant number to quit without additional cessation intervention."

A therapist has to have their own mental health issues well managed, and I dont know if I ever will to the point of being responsible for another person’s well being and state of mind. Yeah, I would be very good at it in the sense that I could relate, but how could I help someone who is paranoid if I’m paranoid myself? Same with depression. I’m not saying it’s impossible, I very well could end up as a therapist later on in life, but I would want to be as sure as possible that my mental health wont suffer from dealing with others mental health problems. There is still a ton of meaningful work to be done in the field of mental health that is a little less one on one."

174372153,"Abstract Background Recent research shows that for every kid who receives an actual autism diagnosis, there is another who has autistic traits including repetitive behaviors and communication problems. Aim The aim of this study was to detect the existence of autistic traits among offspring of schizophrenic patients in the age group from 4 to 11 years, and its association with the sociodemographic data. Patients and methods Sixty-three offspring of schizophrenic patients (who were diagnosed using DSM-IV) from 4 to 11 years of age (based on a pilot study) were selected using a systematic random sampling technique. The Autism Spectrum Quotient-Children’s version (AQ-Child) questionnaire was applied and medical, neurological history and examination, and psychological assessment were carried out for each child. Results According to the AQ-Child, the normal insignificant score of autistic traits ranges from 0 to 45 and no child lied in this category. About 55.6 % of the children scored below the cutoff 
point (46–75) and 44.4% of the children scored above the cutoff point (76). Conclusion The frequency of autistic traits was markedly high in the children of schizophrenic patients. No statistically significant difference was found between above and below AQ score groups as regards sociodemographic and clinical factors, except for socioeconomic status. http://new.ejpsy.eg.net/article.asp?issn=1110-1105;year=2017;volume=38;issue=3;spage=164;epage=171;aulast=Salah Medical News Today Autism Risk Higher When Parents Have Schizophrenia Or Bipolar Disorder Children whose parents or siblings have been diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder have a higher risk of of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs)."

Ghrelin may help prepare for food intake by increasing gastric motility and gastric acid secretion.”"

Being thankful for the small things keep me going. But yeah the medication is doing a number on me. Takes all my motivation away. Makes me so tired. No dopamine. I also know I am going to be single for the rest of my life. I don’t really care about that though. Even before I was schizo I couldn’t keep a relationship.

I was at a mental hospital in _NAME_ in the late nineties that kept me three or four months. I didn’t like it because I was on Zyprexa at the time. Zyprexa has always made me mildly depressed and groggy. My last commitment in 2013 kept me about three weeks. It wasn’t bad.

I think I forgot to post it but I quit as a nurse aide and am now just working at Walmart. I like it. The first couple days I could tell that my stress levels had gone way down. Then Sunday happened and messed that all up. Without music though work can get tough because then I can hear them. I dont see them at work though which is good. I will try to sleep but sleep is hard as at night is when everything is more scary. And when they come to visit me. I will do my best to sleep though.

176118572,I was in the mental ward here and tried to destroy the nurses station. I was stopped right away but some psych tech( I don’t know which ) had to go to the emergency room. I don’t know if I feel guilty. My guilt about so many things is irrational and extreme. Now that I’m home I feel safe with myself. I trust me.
176118573,"And from there concluding that it is inevitable that someone would retaliate. It just sounds a lot like the age old argument that men just can’t help themselves around a pretty girl, so it’s the woman’s responsibility to not be tempting. This argument falls flat when you look into who actually rapes and who gets raped. Fantasy is one thing. acting on it is always and forever only the responsibility of the person committing the action."

176118580,That’s a good idea _AT_MENTION_. I used to take tegratol with it too and ended up without it and I’m doing fine. Do get anxiety but it’s manageable I feel. Compared to other side effects.
176118581,I dont have any cat pics (only dogs here lol) but don’t get too down about the job thing! I got rejected from tons of jobs recently before I finally got accepted by one. I would get so upset but my boyfriend would assure me that most people didn’t get hired for the very first job they applied to. And I would tell myself that if I didn’t get hired there it meant that that job wasn’t meant for me.
174372206,Well a higher dose can also worsen negative symptoms. It all depends on severity and seriousness of your positive symptoms.
176118582,"_PERSON_ does seem a bit offensive, yes _AT_MENTION_. On the other hand, having the term schizophrenia applied does not offend me at all"
176118583,"Maybe it’s unique to me because my old psychiatrist is the only one who ever understood what I mean. I just “feel” that people are invading my space, listening to me as I go about my day. Maybe it’s all in our heads but I get an almost tangible feeling that they are in my apartment, not physically but mentally. I do hear the women laugh in reaction to things I do. When I tell the counselor who visits every three weeks i always play the job card. You guys on here are not the only ones who don’t understand what I’m trying to say. My sisters usually flat out say it’s all in my head and the neighbors are doing nothing. Other times they begrudgingly acknowledge some of the problems i have with neighbors. But I tell everybody: I drive to work through heavy traffic three times a week. I work 6 hours in a building. Before the COVID 19 the building was pretty crowded. I work on a crew, but I’m on my own. I drive home in traffic, come home and cook dinner and clean up after myself, I take one 
college class online per quarter. i lived on my own for twenty years, usually renting rooms in peoples houses where I mingled with them but took care of myself. I’ve been driving my own cars steadily since 1996. I handle my own money, I handle any business with Social Security, the DMV or the IRS etc. I’m not a dummy. I’ve been doing all this for many years and usually i do it very competently. I’m really laying it all out on the line here but I’m trying to make a point. I make all my appointment myself such as to doctors. And then go to them myself. I’m competent enough to do all that (and more) yet people are going to tell me that I’m imagining the ladies next door laughing or screwing with me. Basically, people try to tell me that I can’t tell the difference between total silence, and subtle laughter. No one is going to believe that the crazy women next door do sh*t to drive me crazy and control me. I can do the most complicated paperwork from Social Security myself, and take difficult coll
ege classes and sometimes get good grades but somehow I am imagining power trips from neighbors who are 6 feet away from me on the other side of a thin wall. It’s frustrating and wrecks what little self-confidence I have left. I can see people reading this and dismissing it in one sentence or even one word as delusional or it’s all in my head. When the neighbor lady sits out back and does some mind games that I can almost tangibly feel and I try to figure it out it drives me crazy. But I’m supposed to pretend it’s not happening."

176118588,"Thanks for the compliment _AT_MENTION_! Another game I made up when the girls were toddlers, I called “The Blind game.” I’d put them on my shoulders…they’d wrap their little hands around my eyes so I couldn’t see…then I’d stumble around the apartment picking up random stuff. I’d go “Oh! Is that the phone ringing? I’d better answer it!” Then I’d blindly pick up the iron…hold it to my ear and yell out “Ouch!!” Then I’d say, ""I think it’s raining! Better get my umbrella!

176118599,And it’s only about 3/4 of them who are back. It’s just a little stressful and I have to get used to not having as much space as I’ve been used to for the last three months. It will work out though but one or two of the soldiers were acting like jerks. And I think I alienated a few of them that I actually liked and thought were cool. I didn’t recognize them and I think I may have been rude. It kind of pained me when that happened. But the whole day wasn’t bad of course. Some good stuff happened and there were good moments.
176118600,I’m sorry _AT_MENTION_ I feel run down too but I have low Testosterone levels. Hopefully they will get to the bottom of things and find out what is the issue with your health. Best of luck with everything.

We fell in love like crazy and admitted we’ve never loved anybody the way we love each other. In June on this year I had my first psychotic episode.

I always had a hope my psychosis will resolve but seeing now that It won’t I’m starting my treatment with AP. I’m aware of the side effects and potential ways it will impact my whole life. I love this guy so much I can’t stand the idea of losing it. He has no clue that anything is wrong, he thinks I’m still the old me. What should I do?"

176118655,This doesn’t sound like beneficial behavior _AT_MENTION_. Untreated psychosis is brain damage and will lead to bigger problems. You already seem to be unable to think outside and obsess about delusional things. You need to see a proper psychiatrist and to tell them what you are thinking.

176118665,"The mortality score is now a couple of older relatives on my wife’s side, some older friends in AA in their seventies and eighties, and my sponsor in AA who was pushing 80. That last one really hurt. Biggest changes for me are that I no longer do community volunteering like I used to, I’ve stopped eating out at restaurants (I won’t even order takeaway from any that offer dine-in because who knows with the variants now), and I miss being able to have friends over for dinner and photo print viewing salons. Also? I still do weekly AA meetings, but entirely online. COVID has been a boon there as I much prefer AA meetings on Zoom. Love my comfy loveseat, purring kitty, and a good cuppa. No more stanky church basements and bad meeting coffee for me, ever. That’s a solid win."

Its not so bad anyway! If they are keeping you well - why change it? My pdoc would not even consider a change in meds, until ive given it at least a year on them. If it aint broke - dont fix it."

I felt hated by everyone in Sweden because I was hated there most of the time. I had periods of feeling attacked in Australia too even. Not badly like in Sweden but nasty enough for me to feel it. I feel some people might hate me but I definitely don’t feel hated by everyone anymore. I feel loved enough right now. When I was psychotic I thought Everyone hated me. When I was not psychotic and a child too. N mostly hated as a teen in Onsala too.

174372245,"Did you lack the energy to do those or simply the mood part? If its just the mood part then forcing yourself to do is the best strategy to fight negative symptoms. If lack energy too then check if you have deficiencies like vitamin d, b12, thyroid hormones, heart circulation problems etc. Personally I find thiamine (vitamin b1) very useful for motivation, mood etc. It helps to concentrate on a task for prolonged periods. Zinc helps somewhat in the anhedonia part but some times it can give bad moods too."

I’m very lucky to have all of this thanks to my dad who hired a lawyer to get all of this done. I wasn’t even in the right state of mind when I got disability but I’m very thankful to my dad."

176118755,"My psychotic episodes are triggered by stress and anxiety. I used to get very ill very quickly and I would completely lose it and fall down a black hole and have to be put in hospital to come out of it. They used to persist until treated. I was completely psychotic for nearly a year in 2012 as I evaded treatment and ran away from my home. It was terrible and I have no idea how I finished college. I found some sort of strength somewhere within where I was not going to let it beat me. I had very little insight. The last few years have been more settled. I persevered with 6 different antipsychotics and other medications and fingers crossed the psychosis is dealt with even though my current med is giving me high prolactin. I am off work at the moment as I have periodic bouts of stress and anxiety still that cripples me. I don’t quit my meds any more, so the last couple of years my psychosis has remained stable. My main problem at the moment is dealing with the triggers for my stress and anxiety as ev
en though I don’t get the psychosis part at the moment, it’s still very debilitating when I am trying to work with other people. On top of that I might have Autism, which means that instead of therapy being a cure, it will be coping skills I have been told."

I wish him the best of luck in his career and am always happy to see him again to catch up though not at the moment as life is too stressful.

The voices were backed up by my hallucinations because I assumed others couldn’t see what I saw due to me being able to see the other dimension. Now my voices pop up a little when I’m stressed. I can’t always understand them but at times they have questions related to conversations I’m having. They’re almost helpful some days and I’ve grown to enjoy having them around from time to time. Mine are not critical but they do talk to each other about me. It’s just not overly harsh.
174372269,"Depends on what symptoms you have and where you use it for (it varies per individual). For me, the most important, it restored some severe positive symptoms over a period of 5 years. I have stopped Sarcosine for 5 years now and the symptoms never came back. Most important symptoms it helped me with: “devilish” intrusive thoughts (90%), “devilish” thought disorder (90%) and a feeling that the “devil” had control over one half of my body (100%) motivation and overall negative symptoms (30%) cognition (15%) improvement of mood (10%) The best way to take it to the test is to be aware of your symptoms before the use of Sarcosine and to test whenever you stop with Sarcsosine and to see if those (bothersome) symptoms reemerge. If the symptoms reemerges take it again for a longer period and take it to the test again. There is a study that showed that over time Sarcosine usage restores some NMDA receptors."

Generalized estimating equations assessed whether race and ethnicity were associated with psychiatric symptoms and service use (medication management, family psychoeducation, and individual therapy) over a 24-month treatment period, accounting for baseline symptoms, duration of untreated psychosis, and insurance status.Among persons in usual community care, non-Hispanic blacks scored significantly higher throughout treatment on measures of posit

Families of Hispanic participants in usual community care were less likely than non-Hispanic white families to receive family psychoeducation (OR=.20, p=.01). For NAVIGATE participants, race and ethnicity were not associated with differences in psychiatric symptoms over time; families of non-Hispanic black participants were less likely than those of non-Hispanic white participants to receive family psychoeducation (OR=.53, p=.009). Hispanic participants in NAVIGATE were more likely than non-Hispanic white participants to receive medication management (OR=2.93, p=.001).In usual community care, non-Hispanic blacks scored higher on measures of psychiatric symptoms and were less likely to receive important services, compared with non-Hispanic whites. In

I am going to eat my usual big bowl of raw veggies around 3:30. Hopefully all the crunching gets it out of my system! I feel obsessed with food today. I am not even hungry! On Saturday I put it out there on my weight loss website that I am only 20 pounds away from losing 100 pounds, so now I guess I am reacting in my old patterns to people being supportive. I don’t know how to handle that! I have old patterns of self-destruction and shame that are hard to move on from. Does that make sense? Probably not."

If it doesn’t bother you too much to watch the late 80’s film ‘Communion’ it touched on a man so aware he intentionally went to bed each night attempting to communicate to the other side. en.wikipedia.org Communion (1989 film) Communion is a 1989 drama horror film based on the book of the same name by _PERSON_.

[SE], 0.04 [0.009]; t 34.4 = 4.7; P <.001), and the right hemisphere (? [SE], 0.03 [0.009]; t 35.1 = 3.6; P <.001). Post hoc analyses showed that those who relapsed receiving placebo experienced decreases in cortical thickness compared with those who sustained remission In laymen’s terms, for people who did not relapse, patients who did not take an antipsychotic showed less brain damage. For people who DID relapse, patients who DID take antipsychotics showed less brain damage. All patients showed SOME brain damage."

176118943,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo

174372297,"Zombie. Seriously. This sounds like something you’d tell someone to do on one of your bad advice threads. Those are negative symptoms. What good would going off of your antipsychotic even do? You think you can’t take care of your responsibilities now? Try getting sh it done when you’re out of your mind psychotic. There’s a reason they put us in hospitals against our will. Being psychotic in and of itself makes you a danger to yourself and others. You’ll be so out of it that you won’t know up from down, and you won’t be able to ask for help because you won’t know that you don’t know up from down. If you’re on meds and still hallucinating, then you need to stay on meds. If you’re on meds and not hallucinating, then you definitely need to stay on meds. Sure, you might be perfectly fine going off the injection, but you’ve got so much to lose. Do you really want to take that chance? Please. Please don’t do this to yourself. Chances are it won’t turn out well. And the Invega. 
Doesn’t it act as your mood stabilizer as well? Say you’re bipolar, misdiagnosed with sza. Okay, well, without a mood stabilizer, you’re still going to crash and burn. In fact, it’ll probably be worse, because without a mood stabilizer, that antidepressant is going to wreck you. And what does your doctor think about all of this? Have you discussed it with them? Can you at least try another med? Maybe a weaker one like Vraylar or Rexulti? So that you can at least have some amount of antipsychotics in your system? Or maybe you could switch to the Invega pills and take them at night? Surely there are other things you can try before completely ditching the AP? Please, at least see what your doctor says before you make any decisions."

I accepted their answers too, though they were often in contradiction and even self-contradictory. I was na?ve. I was looking for myself and asking everyone except myself questions which I, and only I, could answer. It took me a long time and much painful boomeranging of my expectations to achieve a realization everyone else appears to have been born with: That I am nobody but myself. But first I had to discover that I am an invisible man! And yet I am no freak of nature, nor of history. I was in the cards, other things having been equal (or unequal) eighty-five years ago. I am not ashamed of my grandparents for having been slaves. I am only ashamed of myself for having at one time been ashamed. About eighty-five years ago they were told that they were free, united with others of our country in everything pertaining to the common good, and, in every
thing social, separate like the fingers of the hand. And they believed it. They exulted in it. They stayed in their place,"

176118990,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo

174372314,"There is some evidence that suggests schizophrenia is not a homogenous diagnosis as we think it is. Instead, schizophrenia might contain subsets of conditions that fall within that broad category. In addition, having one episode of psychosis does not mean you have schizophrenia. I imagine that some people with only one episode of psychosis without having it recurring again may have gotten misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia. Every person with schizophrenia may exhibit a different combination of symptoms. Therefore, each person’s experience with schizophrenia is different. Traditionally, anti-psychotics are better at treating positive symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions, than negative symptoms such as amotivation and memory/concentration issues. Therefore, if a person has schizophrenia where positive symptoms are much less of an issue, then him/her living a relatively calm life without taking anti-psychotics may be possible."

176119113,it’s bad With social media last time I was off meds I was running for president and claimed that I was responsible for _NAME_ (former San _NAME_ mayors ) death. I added every single person I could think of and went from like 10 friends on Facebook to 5k in like a week. I’m surprised the police or fbi didn’t knock on my door honestly . I was so embarrassed after I went back on my pill that like I was scared to even go outside. It gets better after a while and I haven’t seen anyone from my past who i added but I made a couple friends. And i feel like perfectly fine now. From what I was posting you would think I’m a psychopath murderer which I’m not. My advice would be to delete all your social media even if your not mentally ill. If your mentally ill especially schizophrenic or bipolar you can do the same exact thing. It ruins my life every time but I’m resilient and always bounce back. I’m not going off meds again.

KL Fortuna, _PERSON_, _PERSON_, A _PERSON_, _PERSON_, AM _NAME_, PE _PERSON_ and _PERSON_, The Psychiatric quarterly , Jun 2019 01 Examine the unmet needs of people with serious mental illness (SMI) from the perspective of certified peer specialists. 267 certified peer specialists from 38 states completed an online survey (female [73%], 50.9 [SD =?12] years, and non-Hispanic White [79.8%]). Many respondents reported a primary mental health diagnoses (n =?200), 22 respondents reported their diagnosis as schizophrenia spectrum disorder (11%), 46 respondents reported bipolar disorder (22.1%), 47 respondents reported major depressive disorder (22.6%), 29 respondents reported post-traumatic stress disorder (13.9%), 27 respondents reported alcohol/substance use disorder (13%), 2 respondents reported personality disorder (1%), and 12 reported ""other"" (5.8%). A mixed methods convergence analy
sis integrated quantitative with qualitative data. Social isolation (n =?160, 59.9%) and feeling lonely (n =?159, 59.6%) were the most highly endorsed unmet need, followed by the need to address chronic health conditions (n =?80, 30%), prevent mental health hospitalization (n =?71, 23.6%), and prevent drug use (n =?66, 24.7%). Four themes emerged: need to address basic necessities, loneliness and social isolation, hope, and addiction. Addressing loneliness and social isolation were identified as the primary unmet needs among people with SMI. Addressing co-morbid health conditions may simultaneously impact other unmet needs. Hope is an important intervention target. Initial insights from this study can be used to guide researchers' efforts to incorporate certified peer specialists perspectives in developing programs to meet the needs of people with SMI. Future research using participatory research methods can further examine these initial insights."

I changed my mind and told the dr to stop but it was to late and I looked down and saw the nurse and the room covered in blood. I was getting it done in a dr’s office but I freaked out so bad I had to be rushed to the hospital by ambulance to complete the procedure. It was the worst day of my life. I’ve had codeine a couple times since then and the same reaction, psychosis, not as bad, but still. So it’s on my list of meds I’m allergic to. But I can take other pain meds without the same reaction."

176119200,I started generic Pristiq desvenlafaxine for depression and anxiety a month ago. It is an SNRI. I noticed it gives me a little bit of energy from the norepinephrine. After 5 days I noticed that I felt very buzzed almost like I was high. This continued for about a week and now I don’t really think I can feel it. I’m on 50 mg but I don’t think it’s helping very much because I still have anxiety and depression but it’s probably reduced it by 20%. I think I need 100 mg. My only side effects are reduced libido and waking up around 9 am every morning no matter when I go to sleep. Is anyone else on this medication? And if so what do you think about it?

I was wondering if anyone has any experience in similar fields? I would hope to work connecting people to services as I’m not entirely interested in one on one counseling. Its just a thought for now.

They all have names, look different, different backstories they tell me. My body often feels this overwhelming bliss and peace, warm and calm, soothing when they visit. I can feel them standing right next to me, our heads almost touching, they’re taller than me. And this radiant glow comes off all of them. They’re concrete voices, have been with me since my first break, and I still hold delusion that this life and pain are just tests to become chosen after I live it in good standing.

176119261,"One night without sleep actually triggers adrenalin and whatnot in your body so you may find yourself weirdly energetic, but also easily aggravated. More than that and your functioning is going to start dropping bc of how tired you are. I would say that if your sleep is messed up that is definitely going to impact your happiness negatively. Try to fix it with medication if you’ve tried all the natural remedies."
176119262,o shoot really okay thanks.
176119263,Maybe the voices have supernatural powers and they really can kill me
174372355,Did you ever have negatives?
176119264,Inspired by _AT_MENTION_ ’s “The Life Of A Mind Controlled Sex Slave” The vivid images Of bright colors and designs Bothers us with temptation Seeking pleasure with our eyes Landing on a soft wooden branch Its wings spread out with buzz A simple glance is quite enough To arouse our very minds Its quick to disappear yet easy to spot No need to capture the butterfly A lullaby is sung with it’s very presence Still bothering us with feeble temptation. A star was born in the cocoon Its past life had been forgotten Turned a page and smothered by paint A beautiful canvas for all to envision.
174372359,"_AT_MENTION_ write down a schedule and follow it, it’ll help alot. For example, Wake up at 7:30AM Lie in bed for 10 mins Brush teeth Put a pot of coffee on. Pick out some clean clothes Clean your room Do some art So on and so on… You’d be surprised how much it’ll help once you write stuff down. Hope this helps…"
176119265,"What happens if I don’t test for schizophrenia or bipolar? I know I was psychotic, so what explains this? My eyes were even moving by themselves and the doctor said I was in some form of REM and he said it was because of psychosis."
176119266,"Hey, leaf. You seem like a good person to me. But you’re right - everybody can improve. I believe in you."
176119267,"Hey no problem _AT_MENTION_ , were in the same boat. Is there anything you can do to help the cravings? Do you have a piece of hard candy to suck on? I find that helps the cravings a lot Sweden is amazing! I love Stockholm so much! I went out to a bar with my roommate and some of his friends and had a great time. There was blackjack in the bar which blew my mind since that is totally illegal in most US states, and an Iron Maiden cover band which was great. Lost a bunch of money though lol. The food is pretty good, lots of meat and fish. I had some famous swedish meatballs and a surströmming sandwich so far, which were both excellent. But for the most part I grocery shop for things that fit my lame American diet lol"
176119268,Glad for you and om.Are you gonna sue your old pdoc?
174372363,With schizoaffective you have a mix of psychosis and mood symptoms like mania and/or depression. With schizophrenia there usually isn’t a mood component with the psychosis.

I eat a vegan diet for the animals,environment and there’s self care in that to. I don’t usually wear makeup except for lipstick so I like to wear lipstick but nothing else most days as it’s wasy maintenance but still is a bit of I care and nice colour.

176119287,Had great sex/love making with the best lover and orgasmed intensely but could not make him come unfortunately.he makes me come all the time but I can’t seem to release him. Maybe I’m not a good lover?. Did pump at home. Am making a lovely dinner.
174372367,"I am now taking perphenazine. I, foolishly, after doing really really well for 7 years on the abilify, thought I must be cured and didn’t need my meds anymore so I stopped taking them and found myself in the hospital for the next year trying med after med that didn’t work. It took me 3 years to finally land on haldol. That one worked for about 4 years, then it stopped working and I was switched to perphenazine. I’m very happy with the perphenazine now. Switching meds is always hard."

176119291,I just took mine tonight.
174372366,"Why do some schizophrenics acknowledge that they aren’t being “targeted” like they think and some believe the delusion? I have a schizophrenic friend that does nothing but talk about being targeted, and gangstalked. I told her, that this isn’t real. So why after being told it’s not real, does she continue to believe? Could it be because she’s joined a Facebook group that confirms her thoughts?"
176119292,I’m _NAME_’s friend!
176119293,"Good, everhopeful"
176119294,"Yeah, looking forward, tomorrow i am sober, clear headed and fresh to meet the days obstacles"
176119295,"Maybe I should switch meds, I don’t know. But I’m a little scared to do so, maybe I end up on something that gives me worse side effects. Maybe I just had a bad day."
176119296,"The anxiety is hard to judge. I am not convinced Pregabalin is helping - and I have tolerance to Diazepam now and that does not help Depression wise, I refused the meds and been of them for 6 weeks. I believe my depression as a minimum to be situational, and not deserving of a diagnosis Anxiety has always been a problem, but my old pdoc never diagnosed me with it."
176119297,"The days when they are a little bit quieter and all I can hear is chatter, I go out and do things they would get angry at me for doing so I didn’t feel as alone. I’m terrified if one day I wake up and there not there."
176119298,"If it weren’t for my hubby, I doubt anyone would want me, too. I’m pretty boring all around. And nowadays, everyone wants someone who is fit and thin, has a job and is financially secure, etc. etc. I agree- people have double standards. I’ve even seen it on the boards here: “I want a really hot girl…” when the guy isn’t so great looking himself. Just accept people for who they are already."
174372371,"The problem is that narcicism is a medical diagnosis, not a personality trait. It would be like saying schizophrenia is within everyone and blaming that for a pandemic. Narcicists didn’t choose to become narcicists for laughs. They require proper treatmwnt just like we do, to ensure their disorder doesn’t hurt others."
176119299,I avoided a direct gaze in the mirror for the same reason. I wouldn’t admit the self love just wasn’t there.

176119321,"I have felt like that at times myself, but i wouldn’t call it Avoidant Personality Disorder. I think if you had this disorder you would more or less be a hermit. Living away from everyone and doing everything in your power to have nothing to do with other people. Feeling as though people don’t want you near them to me says you have low self-esteem. Or perhaps you are a little paranoid. Either way, i think you should bring up your feelings at your next scheduled appointment with your doctor and see what they have to say. I’m not a doctor after all."
176119322,"Have hope: for people like myself who was formerly diagnosed sz actually recover or have substantial reduction of their symptoms. Sz isn’t the end of the world. People are suffering from a variety of issues. Diagnosis come and go. I was formerly diagnosed sz too but now my doctor changed my dx to psychotic depression. I would ask you to trust your doctor. At your age, I know it’s hard to trust them. You think you know your best, but I think people who have studied their entire life in medical school will know better. I was like you when I was younger too. You are definitely not alone."

176119337,It’s so awful…finally I am able to sleep again but my sleep is more disrupted than ever for no known reason. My bladder is fairly under control with medication so I am not waking up to pee. I will have these very vivid dreams that feel like they last hours or days even. Then I wake up and inevitably only an hour or 2 has passed. It feels like it takes an eternity to get through every night. And tonight I’ve been having nightmare after nightmare and it makes me not want to sleep anymore. I just woke up from one where I found a baby hanging in my basement. Not ok. I’m sick of this and don’t know what to do.

176119379,"Some things I do to calm down are: Put an ice pack on the back of your head. This will cool down your brain and reduce activity in your limbic system, where emotions happen. Do a task with simple, clear steps. I like baking. I follow the recipe, and it’s easy enough that I don’t get frustrated, but it requires enough concentration that I don’t have room to think about other things. Cleaning also helps. Engage your five senses. This will remind you what is real and what isn’t. Listen to soothing music. Smell something pleasant, like an essential oil. Suck on a hard candy. Look at pictures of things you enjoy. Feel something with an interesting texture, like a piece of Velcro or a stress ball. Try to levitate something with your mind. You obviously won’t succeed, but it gets you to focus all of your attention on a single point outside your body, instead of on your thoughts. I like to use this on airplanes or in public places, because it doesn’t require you to move at all. It looks like yo

176119395,"Yeah and she doesn’t feel like I experience mania and right now wants me to go through prolonged exposure therapy, which we’re starting tomorrow. I just haven’t seen her since it was brought up but I thought i should ask others who experience the same I do"

176119404,"I’m not sure how to keep my illness a secret. When I am in mood episodes, they’re so prominent that I look like I’m either on ecstasy or I am slow moving, slow speech, slow everything and exhausted. When I’m psychotic it’s even harder, because I start talking about government conspiracies to everyone or about colors injecting me in the brain with thoughts. I guess maybe it will be easier when I’m more stable?"
176119405,_AT_MENTION_ did you ever look further into those pluripotent stem cells therapy I was suggesting to you a while back?
176119406,"Is it possible you also have visual hallucinations. I remember being at the hospital when quite unwell and thinking my neighbors where there one as patient and other as nurse also the student psychologists voice after i met her started talking to me and then i kept seeing her every time i left the ward thought she was watching me for them while i was on leave with my family there also thought my aunt and uncle had been to see me after a very realistic dream, in reality 1 guy looked slightly like 1 neighbo the nurse only had the same name as the other one and the student psychologists worked there i just took seeing her way to far in my mind. Even when i remember back now i dont know how i got so confused."

176119411,You still belong here. Don’t leave us just because you feel unqualified.
176119412,Yeah never mix it with alcohol. Also try not to exceed doses over 0.5mg a day. But this would be between you and your doctor
176119413,I’m 27 and feel this way frequently
176119414,i feel pretty good on invega ive been on it a month and a week its alot different from zyprexa side effect wise zyprexa helped alot but the side effects were almost intolerable and if i would have stayed on it i can imagine i would have tons of health problems in the future

174372397,"At first I thought my addiction issues were from sz but after stopping meds (Abilify) for a year, I was myself, no impulsions or addictions or hypersexuality. Its shortly after that that I was sure its the Abilify after reading the FDA and Health Canada warnings about Abilify. I told my psychiatrist and he said its possible so he stopped Abilify."

176119418,I’m pretty sure I got discharged because I told my pdoc that the hospital felt more like home than home did
174372401,My doctor told me Abilify decreases Dopamine and increases Serotonin.
174372404,Yeah I hated the drooling.
176119419,yeah i dont have any friends in school my only friend is older than me and lives far away but in my country
176119420,okay thanks i will ask my pdoc.

176119427,"Does anyone have suggestions for YouTube videos to watch that are relaxing, boring, and soothing? I am feeling increased stress and anxiety lately which is also causing insomnia. I have a couple of YouTube videos posted below that I watch that are somewhat boring, yet also soothing at the same time. Watching them seems to help me relax and fall asleep. Given my increased issues with insomnia recently, I need to expand my collection of sleep-inducing videos. I would really appreciate some recommendations for boring, soothing, and relaxing videos to help me fall asleep. ."

176119430,I started quitting cigs during a psychotic break. I finished quitting 3.5 years later.
176119431,Parental abuse is hard to live through. I understand I’ve been through abuse too. It’s hard because loving your parents is normal. And it’s hard to think of turning your back on them. You’re not alone in these feelings. I want you to know you’re not broken. And I know its hard. It’s ok to not 100% support your parents. It’s ok to be mad or upset about ways they’ve mistreated you. It’s ok to be hurt about the times they weren’t there for you. And it’s ok to express these things. I’m here if you ever need or want to talk. I hope you feel better soon
176119432,"No problem ! I love your paintings, especially the facial ones."
174372391,"You have to ask your psychiatrist, some antipsychotics are used for depression. What’s your diagnosis? Injection and oral are similar. Injection are better if you forget to take your pills everyday or if you’re not treatment compliant."
176119433,It is my heart he controls with feelings when ever im happy he curses me…
176119434,"It’s seems to be based around feeling insane or off all the time. I’m hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts and am isolated in my apt forever and on disability. I don’t always call it sza though since I believe it’s not just sza, it’s lots of things that have me feeling off, such as the life or lack of life that I feel I have lived or not believing in myself and alternate realities. But, I guess much of my life has been centered around ending up in the psych ward, seeing pdocs, being on disability, feeling abnormal so you could say it is."
176119435,i’m good =) how are you today?
176119436,"You work in your state. Stop being down on yourself, that’s huge."

176119439,Is it too paranoid for me to think that we might be risking infection if we get close enough to a bunch of kids to hand out candy?
176119440,"Yes. I hear two voices, both related to visual hallucinations. One tells me to do positive things–it’s a child’s voice. One tells me to do negative things–it’s my step mother’s voice. (She abused me as a child)."
174372402,Every appointment I have with pdoc I tell her about the severe negative symptoms (ex. No motivation). She looks around on her computer and never comes up with anything to try. I think many of the meds interact in a bad way with my Clozapine.
176119441,I know. You’re right. The jacket probably wouldn’t be that big with sweaters.
174372398,"I hear voices and see visions of 15 people, and I know them all. Some of the visions are caused by them on purpose, and the rest are the schizophrenia taking a blind guess, or adding a response. Schizophrenic voices mostly say similar things, from person to person, as if they are trained to say negative criticisms mixed with threats, and other dumb, unwanted comments. Today’s voices were: your dad will kill you either way, you’re dead for that, don’t smoke, don’t eat anything else, move far away now or your dad will kill you, they saw your future and your hands were tied with rope, threats about being drowned, your dad kills you at the mall, don’t smoke or we will give you a heart murmur, you won’t be able to date ever again, don’t eat that, go for a drive instead."
176119442,I feel EXACTLY the same right now! Been stable for two or three months and there’s something strange about missing psychosis but there you have it. I’m not alone and it feels good. I’m on my meds for my husband’s sake as I don’t want him to suffer. He’s suffered enough with my frequent hospital stays (six in eight years since I got married) and we almost gave up on our relationship because of my sza.
176119443,"I function well like a normal person almost. But I have severe symptoms of Anhedonia, depression, PTSD, Other side effects. I don’t know how I’m still living."
174372405,I’m always pretty content and happy. I have no complaints.
176119444,Its called advertising to make money from non-prescription supplements and books. I didn’t fall into that trap and my psychiatrist told to never believe what others are saying about SZ.
176119445,? m confused between this two terms. Both of them false belief about fear of harm from something or someone. So what is exactly separating these two terms?
176119446,What’s his version?
176119447,"A bit more abstract stuff. Not saying they don’t make me thinking something karmaish as they do, but these might work for me in a special manner. The hello kitty anti?"

176119449,Never heard someone say bipolar is nice lol. I know _PERSON_ West said it was like having a super power. I’ve only been manic from drugs I’ve taken and I really enjoyed it.
176119450,You really need to speak to your treatment team ASAP.
176119451,"Nothing really to me. People want me on them, but my issues dont improve much, especially when thats all they offer."
174372411,Thanks _AT_MENTION_. Appreciate it.
176119452,I can only tolerate small doses of Klonopin. I’m highly sensitive to benzos. I took less than 0.25 mg.
174372413,"I feel this way too. I’m so alone. People don’t like me because of my schizophrenia. Sometimes I don’t know if I will be able to live the rest of my life with this illness, with this loneliness."
176119453,"My daughter was first diagnosed ADHD and prescribed Ritalin, Concerta and then Vyvanse. She really didn’t do too well on the meds. She always struggled at school anyway. Around age 13 she was rediagnosed bi-polar and started taking risperidone. That was awful. She gained so much weight and started getting into big time trouble. Later on around age 18-19 she tried Vyvanse again and reported being able to focus and concentrate better. So maybe she’s is ADHD and bipolar. Right now she’s unmedicated and we all just hope she stays stable."

176119478,Several years ago during the ending of the _NAME_ craze waiting for the 7th book I became convinced that if _PERSON_ died something bad would happen to me. I felt that I was carrying _PERSON_ along in another world and helping him be more normal. So when the last book came out I just skimmed it until I found out about _PERSON_ and I went into a real bad break after that.
176119479,"It worked for my mom, but she ain’t schizophrenic. She lost weight, felt better, and had less physical (back) pain. She stopped it because she lacks consistency and self control. It’s also hard when other family members don’t follow the diet. I won’t do it because it’s too hard, but I think it works and could help my health. That and I think it’s expensive and hard. I don’t know and don’t like cooking for sure. The problem is the weight comes back super fast after you stop the keto diet. My mom gained all her weight back and she loves carbs."

I’d consider that pretty bloody cool and would love it as a background… All’s I can say is don’t take it to heart. It’s not your problem it’s theirs so don’t take it too heart. We are always our harshest critiques in social situations because we think of the things others don’t. They probably didn’t even think anything of it…

To me, that is schizophrenia. I guess I have paranoia and psychosis and bizarre thoughts. Sometimes I have doubts and stuff and think I was drugged or tortured in this life and I’m a clone with psychic powers or something and other things and that I don’t need meds, but I do. Is it the drinks that make me psychotic? But no one cares and no one will listen. People get offended and deny such things go on in this life/world. I tried to build a simulation in a distant past life I think and probably built or helped build a time machine in a past lives and actually time travelled. They don’t want us to have simulations, which I agree. I hope it’s just these two. I couldn’t handle living in a Chinese or whatever simulation again. The aliens destroyed a lot of the simulations because they were too sick and evil. As bad a

It was showing someone who I had seen last at that residence. It was not a hallucination (in my situation/point of view), and I heard a voice say, “What do you want to say to him?” They were implying the individual they were showing that was in my residence that they were showing on the TV. In my opinion they have access to some type of technological device that can do many different functions."

If you don’t get rejected, it could be a great relationship. But otherwise… it sounds like erotomania. It’s better not to let it go unchecked though or it could get worse."

176119539,Hey _AT_MENTION_ I can relate. I’m emotionally a lot more bland these days on the meds. I think it’s a combination of both the meds and the sz but I’m flatter for sure. It takes a lot of my energy to get through the day and I am definitely more self involved. I don’t think that is necessarily a bad thing…I still do care about people but I’m just locked into a mode where it’s really not as pronounced as I was pre psychosis.

Sure _USER_ID_ is real and it sucks if someone fears you, but you’re being way too hard on yourself without any help from anyone else. I’ve suffered too so I understand your frustration but you don’t need to be so hard on yourself. You’re probably as nice as anyone else so you don’t deserve to torture yourself like this. Maybe now it’s out of your system and you’ve calmed down and you can see that the vast majority of people, including yourself, could not be as bad as you make yourself out to be. Schizophrenia doesn’t make us terrible people. It robs us of confidence and self esteem but most schizophrenics are perfectly nice if given a chance. Don’t believe all that negative stuff you told yourself, it ain’t true. I understand going through a bad time, but that’s all it is. And when you’re upset you’re not thinking right and everything seems negative, it’s usually just an illusion though. You HAVE to ha

176119554,The brain is complicated and although there seems to be a genetic complication there’s no proof or reason to why some get it and others don’t…Also. Dopomine seems a key but there’s other brain chemicals involved and we simply don’t know why … Also. I think we’ve reached the limit on dopamine chemicals. We are searching for better models where a different model would be better. My two cents.

I’ve been fighting with mental illness of various kinds beginning about a year and a half ago, beginning with intrusive thoughts, which led to psychosis, which eventually led to the diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, pretty mild case. I’ve been able to somewhat function without medicine, of course I’m not my old self but I haven’t been able to do what I used to. Would and of you think it’s a safe bet to try and fight without the medication? My family wants me to try it, but I’m scared of not being able to ever leave it. Any advice? Thanks for your time"

Please use your logical brain to consider why you would be putting yourself down for trying to cope effectively in a difficult world/situation. Please don’t put too much emphasis on a label. Try to consider your strengths. You’ve probably got a lot more of them than problems. Find things to be grateful for. Try using YouTube to find meditation aps that speak to you. Find a behavior to self-soothe rather than the dermatophagia. Sing. Write. Meditate. Pray. Draw. Whatever works for you. Warmest wishes!"

176119589,"I think it might be comforting for a very limited time. I think living there would get old, fast. Probably the thing that would bug you the most is what most people say about hospitals. They’re boring, there’s not enough to do to keep you busy for a whole day. So you would be stuck with 10 or 20 other patients who you may not even like, and you would watch TV all day. Even if it’s a good hospital with PC’s in it, it would get boring being on the internet 6 or 7 hours a day."

174372448,Everyone was telling me I had schizophrenia. Like I went back to take a psychology class and people would raise their hands and say “ummm schizophrenia” even though they knew it was the wrong answer just because they knew I had it. But they were sitting next to me and then the person on the other side stared at me in the eyes after the girl said schizophrenia. Well you think this is a delusion but it’s not. Everyone in my small catholic school knew me as “the schizophrenic kid”. Then I had to do a program after I got arrested and everyone was doing the same thing. “Hey…schizophrenia”. And my doctor told me I was schizophrenic but I wasn’t. But every where I go I hear schizophrenia schizophrenia schizophrenia. I say that must be the reason. And I began to accept it. But I wasn’t schizophrenic I was schizoaffective so all those kids who spread rumors about me were WRONG.
176119592,i’d go with that list to your pdoc… maybe you need some med adjustment and/or therapy i’d say
176119593,it’s weird how you keep going back and forth… some days you agree and some days you say you not sick. Then moments you say you gonna stop all your meds and like an instance longer you ask about xeplion…

I partially gave them up because at the time my landscaping biz was taking off and i was working 16+ hours a day. Now im drinking every day and family only triggers me.

174372452,"I’ve always been of two minds on this topic which comes up every now and then. I think the entry card to these forums really should be a diagnosis of schizophrenia. However, if there are participants here who are suffering but don’t quite fit the label…but do share similar afflictions… and find relief and support on this website, then who am I to judge? I’m not heartless. Our tent is big enough to welcome people with different types of mental illness.

Too often, our society looks down on a man who does those things. As a result, men can feel very isolated and alone in their struggles, and confused about how to ask for help."

176119718,"My ideal guy is Chinese American though the guy I actually like is Japanese American. He’d live in Honolulu, work a day job, take me out for Curryhouse chicken curry with soda Friday night after work. I wouldn’t work, we’d just live off his salary and my parent’s salary and my ssi disability check. In my free time I’d go out to support groups and cafes and art museums with friends. He’d be someone I can brag about, like someone my friends think is cool. We’d do fun stuff together like walk my dogs, shop for groceries, watch sci-fi movies and minions, hike somewhere that is really easy for me, and think up ways to get involved with activities that can help others like by making friends with the Buddhist group. It’d be cool if he could come to the mental illness dinner with me. There’s lots of homeless and he might not want to because he’s rich. Even though I don’t have as many romantic ideas as in the past, I wish he’d see things through my perspective. We’d also go to my h
igh school carnival where I got a full ride and made lots of friends, go visit my family in China and go visit a lake, go on occasional trips like to Japan, and have two kids! I’d also like to read books in bed, make dessert for the kids, have parties, and take the kids to different lessons of their choosing like art or swimming or Church camp. and I’d make sure my friends hung out often. Anyways I want to do lots of cute stuff together and live in Honolulu. I’m turning 30 next year and I’m feeling more and more like a mom and less like someone just looking for love. I still believe my ex will come back one day. I hate people who underestimate my interest in the arts because I actually have a very deep understanding and can retain a lot of information from what I read. It’s cool when a guy can show me something I actually want to know and I find that romantic. I’ve dated rich kids and I’m not interested in their lives unless they involve dealing with poor people. I find poor people activities li
ke sitting in the park, playing on the playground at night, eating ramen, to be romantic. Also Chinese stuff like weddings decked in red, dim sum, and the extended family.

176119737,"Ahh, I see, you still think that this is being written by someone in the midst of a “psychotic break”. I’m not, so it is not. I had an episode about 2 months ago now, but right now, here, in this moment, this here one here, I’m fine. I’m perfectly calm and clear-headed. What you interpret as ‘ramblings’, are in fact perfectly clear, chronologically and/or logically organised, posts. I have my feet well and truly planted on the ground. I changed me, but I’m still me. I’m just not the angry, hate-filled, petty, sarcastic, pessimist that I used to be. I don’t view myself as “special” in anyway at all. In fact a large portion of my “episodes” is always me agonising over finding a way to be in no way “special”. All beings are equal. - “Special” doesn’t fit well with that. I love interacting with others. Sometimes, if I’m in an “episode” strange things can happen. Last time I had an episode (2 months ago), I got lost in thought, and went for a walk. To keep a l
ong story short, I ended up walking 36-42 miles, on a hot day, with the wrong footwear, and no food or water. I walked from 9am to 3am the next morning. Then a police officer drove along and noticed me in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night. Well, he gave me a lift home. No cuffs, no pat-down, just a lift home. When I thanked him for the lift and told him that I wouldn’t forget tonight for a long time, he replied: “Yes, that was a very long walk.” To which I replied: “No, I mean because I met a genuinely nice person.” The look on his face made the whole walk worthwhile. A few days later I got mugged, I’ll rephrase that, because nobody ever cares, and I do mean nobody. A few days later I was the victim of a robbery with violence, and being in the middle of an “episode”, I was behaving a little oddly. Nobody seemed to be doing anything about the fact that I had just been mugged. The police didn’t ask what happened, what they looked like, how many there were…They did what was ta
ken, so that was something I guess. Anyway, basically, I sat down folded my arms said something along the lines of “I’m just going to sit here until someone at least tries to get my vaping device back.”. Needless to say, because the records showed that they’d taking me to hospital once before, they took me again. As I waited in a small room with a police officer, for the hand-over from police to hospital security I spoke to him about this and that. After a while I looked up at him, for he was standing while I was seated, and his eyes were filled with tears. I sort of thought “Oops” and comforted him a bit. The next day I heard a few odd comments, apparently related to things that I had said the night before. Then I started to notice that a very attractive, but younger nurse seemed to be going “all coy” whenever I looked her in the eye. “Odd” I thought “I must be imagining it. Perhaps she’s just a little shy.”. Then I noticed it happening with the nurse who took over the shift, but no
t to the same extent. Still, “Two swallows do not a summer make.”, so I dismissed it. The next day, Sunday, yup the old “Gotta wait 'til Monday to see a doctor so you’re stuck in here today mate.” situation. Later that day, I happened to look up, and caught the nurse from yesterday, in ‘mid-tigress-growl-with-claws’ pose, at me. Then Monday, after seeing the Doctor and being cleared for release, I was sent to see the “person from the social services”. She was considerably younger than me, very pretty, and…Again, every time I looked her in the eyes she went all coy, blushed a little and looked down and to the left. I just stopped looking in her direction after awhile. So, yes, I love human interaction, I don’t seek it out, but I love it. When I’m not having an “episode” I greet people that I meet on the street, and occasionally have little chats with them about this and that. So no, I’m not “stuck” feeling all “special” or “different”. I’m not “manic”. I’m just 
little old me. All that I can suggest is that you slow down and take the time to read and think about what I have written. It’s not disorganised ramblings, it is very clear, if you don’t just “skim read” it."

I remained mostly functional, I was medicated for depression for a time and was then was mostly ok. But I was always considered an odd child and I was taken to many Drs to try to find out what was wrong with me. I don’t think anyone ever came up with a diagnosis but maybe no one told me. I had a few small vivid delusions or what I call waking lucid dreaming that lasted less than a day. But I didn’t have a full blown schizophrenia episode until I was about 47. Voices from the TV and all that. I know my onset is not typical. I have been through neuropsychological exams and they say consistent with schizophrenia.

I think I took refuge in this form, and now memories that were placed on my soul are unlocking. In part I believe I’ve always been. In some form or another, not always conscious, but as some primordial force of will unto myself. I can feel them judging me. But also protecting me. I’m thankful for that.

176119876,"There is an important component of delusions. A person becomes convinced that their beliefs are true before they start to evaluate them. In other words, the decision to believe is made subconsciously. Rational thought occurrs after the decision is made. I am not prepared to quote exact sources at present. I am yet to process this completely. However this notion made leaps towards health for me . Therefore it is very difficult to impossible to rationalize oneself out of a delusion. Every madman here says that they struggle to get rid of delusions. Often despite medication. Madmen did not make a mistake in their thinking. There was an error before any thonging took place, on the tier of subconscious. Try to discard the notion of telepathy completely."

My current psychiatrist agreed i do not have schizophrenia though, but other psychosis, and wasnt as sensitive to psychosis as is seen in sz…so i might respond differently. I hope Abilify works. 2.5 is a very low dose. I used 10mg."

176119909,I’ve seen a lot of doctors in my life and met some real quacks. I started seeing my current doctor in 2001. I had an appointment with him 2 days before he died. He was a good guy and helped me win my disability case. He stood up for me and did everything he could to help me over the years. When I was out of work his office gave me free medication for years. He had a pharmacy in his office. He also gave me discounted visits at half price. He worked as an outpatient resource at a local hospital. He was head of the board for psychiatry. I’m going to miss him he was good to me.

174372534,"The fake thoughts seem to be smarter than I was, in ways I described above. If I am that smart, then it means my intelligence and creativity was for some reason restricted before schizophrenia hit me fully. The fake thoughts can talk to me (mostly telling me “You’re going to be tortured after death” more than 100 times a day) I’ve had an empty thought (I felt there was a fake thought, but it had no content). I don’t think there can be empty thoughts in other people. The fake thoughts feel different from normal thoughts, and there have been different versions of fake thoughts by their feeling. There is something intelligent (whether a process in my brain, or something else, I don’t know) controlling them, something that gives them an entirely different purpose from normal thoughts. Their purpose has been mostly 1)) to accuse me of various things, and 2)) to tell me I’m going to tortured after death forever. The analysis of the projects I had planned before started only recently. Accord
ing to the voices the purpose of that is to show how they’re more intelligent than I am/was."

176119934,Because ‘help’ is being industrialized in a way that causes people to ‘do a job’ based on what they learn and not what they feel. What’s maddening to me is how little people understand this and how little people realize how much more ‘substance use’ there is beyond ‘drugs’. Food is probably the number one ‘substance’ people use to avoid pain from unwanted situations and living with some negative people who use all kinds of things to cover their negative emotions/resentments/etc…

I attribute it to the environment… I used to live in rough conditions, but now I live with a very supportive family member in an environment with less stress and a lot more kindness. However it could just be random… Mean voices are the worst. They really wear you down over time, and you can only ignore them so much. I’ve been hearing voices for almost 6 years now. For me the best way to reduce them is to ignore them… if I talk back, they start talking a lot more. I really hope things ease up for you. It’s also easy to forget that when you’re alone, you truly are alone. The voices aren’t really conscious beings so you still have your privacy even though it seems like you don’t."

Objective: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and _NAME_-analysis of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of FA + AP for schizophrenia. Methods: The primary outcome was an improvement in total symptoms. Other outcomes were psychopathology subscales (positive, negative, general, and depressive symptoms), discontinuation due to all-cause and adverse events, and individual adverse events. The _NAME_-analysis evaluated the effect size based on a random-effects model. Results: Although we included ten RCTs with 925 patients in total (seven folic acid RCTs (n = 789), two methylfolate RCTs (n = 96), and one folinic acid RCT (n = 4
0)) in the systematic review, only seven RCTs were included in the _NAME_-analysis. Pooled FA + AP treatments were not superior to placebo + AP in the improvement of total (N = 7, n = 340; standardized mean difference (SMD) = - 0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = - 0.41, 0.02, p = 0.08, I2 = 0%), positive, general, or depressive symptoms. Pooled FA + AP treatments were more effective than placebo + AP for negative symptoms (N = 5, n = 281; SMD = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.49, -0.01, p = 0.04, I2 = 0%). Although pooled FA + AP treatments were associated with a lower incidence of serious adverse events than placebo treatments (N = 4, n = 241; risk ratio = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12-0.82, p = 0.02, I2 = 0%; number needed to harm = not significant), there were no significant differences in other safety outcomes between both treatments. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that pooled FA + AP treatment improves negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients. Moreover, this treatment was well tolerated. However, because our results mi
ght exhibit a small-study effect, future studies with a larger sample should be conducted to obtain more robust results."

I could look at it as a coincidence or I could look at it like it has some great cosmic meaning and try to figure out what it means. But it’s a lousy sweatshirt! I have a hard time believing that sweatshirts have the meaning of life in them. If you look at it like “god” or some all knowing being who created the universe it just makes me wonder why he’s using stuff like old sweatshirts, licence plates, TV’s, etc to unlock the secrets of the universe. I mean if he is so all knowing and powerful and can do miracles why doesn’t he do stuff like make three continents have 9.3 earthquakes at the same time?That would sure get my attention.

Mark _PERSON_, PhD, DClinPsy, director of research and honorary senior research fellow at the University of Sussex, United Kingdom, adds, “The cause of auditory hallucinations is often, but not always, rooted in traumatic early experience. Almost all of our patients have experienced significant adversity for extended periods of their lives, and this adversity is often reflected in the identity of their voices. For example, the voice may be a mother or father who was neglectful or abusive, or bullies from school, and the comments they make may be critical and derogatory.”"

176120011,"My girlfriend at the time and I were sitting in my car one night. She pointed up to the sky and said…“If I wished upon that Star, would you make my dreams come true?” She wanted me to propose marriage to her. So I went home that night and penned this… Beautiful to Me Well she always wears a smile Under green eyes faded blue As she lays down there beside me And whispers ‘I love you’. Won’t you tell me all your troubles You know I’ve got some too If we spend a little time We can work things through And sometimes I wonder Could you be any more beautiful Still I wonder could you be any more Beautiful…to me If I wished upon a Star Would you make my dreams come true Or will you live your life promising Those empty words 'I do’ They say love can’t wait forever Believe you me I’ve tried Tell me we will be together And never question why And sometimes I wonder Could you be any more beautiful Still I wonder could you be any more Beautiful…to me"

176120016,"First of all, that’s not a delusion, that’s just an over-valued idea. Sort of like magical thinking. Secondly, we all know prolactin affects men, the point is that women and men are different, so prolactin affects them differently, and men can’t get pregnant. You do not know if men can get this delusion as a side-effect, and you are apparently not even delusional about this. You should stop pursuing it."
174372570,"Hi, _AT_MENTION_ ! Welcome to the community! I went through a similar situation with my first psychotic break. I was seeing “ghosts” or “spirits”. Sometimes it really scared me, but most of the time I was just curious, like you. I was completely convinced that ghosts were haunting me and that I had a special connection to spirits. I’m glad you are on a medication that is helping your hallucinations and delusions. My medicine / antipsychotic that I’m taking has helped me tremendously with my delusions. Take care."

I’ve had conversations, one lasted for a half hour around the holidays, my aunt that passed away was telling me all this stuff that would happen to her kids in the future. I was talking back, but eventually I wanted her to stop talking to me. I do believe it was her because she kind of acted the way _NAME_ did from “It’s a Wonderful Life” did before he got his wings. They ease drop on me when I’m in public, if they read my mood, that’s when they can start scaring me like saying I’m dieing of stage 4 cancer, all last year people were telling me dates I would die, and I couldn’t do anything because I was afraid to see family/get connected, I just wanted to die alone. I stopped going out in public in fear of more information… It was nuts"

I kept on going off my meds and ending up in the hospital. I wasn’t stable at all. I have been stable now for almost 3 years on invega sustenna. Even with a six year gap I was still able to get a job, but it didn’t last. A family member of mine was able to get a decent job after a 10 year gap. She did so good that after 3 weeks into the job, the placement where the agency placed her hired her on."

176120050,When I was delusional and psychotic I thought my husband wanted me dead. At no time did I ever want to hurt him. I chose to try and take my own life to get away from him instead. Thankfully at no time have I ever wanted to cause harm to anyone. Apart from the “my husband wanting me dead” delusion all the others were rather nice. Like going next door to the Care Flight Doctors and asking if they wanted to play Twister!

174372567,"I have many problems with neighbors. With some neighbors I think it is a little of a culture thing and I gather they think very poorly of me. I was friendly with the two older ladies next door for awhile but that went south starting 9 or 10 months ago. But at first they liked me and I liked them so I’ll put on my resume that I get along with women as usual. But incidents happened that I thought were deal breakers and I thought there was mutual animosity between us. And I started pounding on the ceiling occasionally when the dangerous jerk-off upstairs taunted me. But the property manager told me that was a reason enough to get evicted so I quit cold turkey. But I might have cussed out neighbors and they complained but that stopped several months ago. But just last week the counselor for this apartment was over here for a meeting. I get along great with her as she pointed out just two weeks ago. She understands me because we are both from the same generation and when my roommate lost her mind and 
claimed I had several restraining orders against me which was blatantly untrue, and that I pounded on her door (again not true, I knocked on her door to remind her of a meeting) and said she was scared of me (yes, 77nick77 is a vicious, dangerous guy) (not). Anyways, the counselor understands that it is more likely I would be taken advantage of by certain women or men then to scare. But anyways I walked out back last week to ask the older woman if they were bothering me. I’ve knocked on the losers door upstairs a few times and he never answers but my point is that I’m not singling out women, I voice my complaints to men (if you can call them that). But I was polite to the neighbor woman and she denied bothering me but as I turned away to leave her alone her face lit up like a Christmas tree or the Fourth of July and she grinned at me. She must have seen my good side and she saw I don’t hate her (I have felt those feelings before but I still like a part of her). But she immediately warmed up to me and it 
was such a relief to her that we started talking like old friends. She told me she gets “Meals on Wheels” which is a program here in California that brings meals to seniors to their front door and she said she has a couple of extra meals that I can have. I was astounded this was happening but I went along with it and she also gave me a half-gallon of milk and promised me more food and just like that the feud could have ended. But enter schizophrenia. I assumed she had some angle or ulterior motive and this was a way to take advantage of me. And I still heard laughter and it still felt like they were listening into my apartment as I moved around. But when I saw them walk by I happen to be in a good mood so I gave them neutral looks. But just an hour ago I got home and pulled into parking space out back and the older lady just happened to be heading out there to sit. Assuming we were still on bad terms I tried not to look at her or bother her. But then she abruptly went back to her apartment and she looked 
perturbed, confused and maybe just a tiny bit hurt. I judge situations wrong all the time but it dawned on me that she thought our feud was over too and that my appropriate response should have been to look at her and be friendly. And that’s what disturbed her. I blew it. I could really, really use an ally here or at least a little relief on at least just one of the fronts from the crap coming to me from all directions. I blame myself and schizophrenia. I think if I had relief and peace from at least just one direction I could stay here and handle the rest. Now, the plan to move is back on."

While I was on rexulti then on Latuda, I was waking up at 3 am EVERY night and was unable to fall asleep after. This problem is well known by a lot of users of these antipsychotics. I sleep well on Zyprexa but it has many downsides. Saphris as been a good alternative to Zyprexa for me during 2 years. It is sedative (so you will sleep well) but it will not slow down your brain too much. Also, it will not make you take weight."

Method?:?The participants were 51 stabilized outpatients with schizophrenia. Their mean age was 38.91 (SD?=?10.73) years. Life skills were assessed using the Life skills profile (LSP). Cognitive function was evaluated with the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB). Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS), the Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) and the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). Results?:?Cognitive function was not correlated with the LSP scores at all. Amon
g clinical symptoms, scores of the PANSS positive and negative syndrome scales, the CDSS, and the DIEPSS had negative correlations with the LSP total score and the subscales. Stepwise regression analyses showed that the CDSS and PANSS negative syndrome scale scores were independent predictors of the LSP total score and two of the subscales. Conclusions?:?These results indicate that cognitive function is not associated with life skills but clinical symptoms such as depressive and negative symptoms have considerable impacts on life skills in people with schizophrenia.

It takes getting used to for sure and it’s hard to accept all the changes in your life but hey, stick around here and you’ll see plenty of people doing stuff in their life; from working to going to school to getting married. And lots of other stuff. And I see people complaining about their lives but two days later they will list some nice little victory such as going out with a friend or going out to eat with their parents or exercising or a multitude of other accomplishments. That’s how schizophrenia affects everybody, and that’s how life in general affects people who don’t have schizophrenia too. One day you’re up, and the next day you’re down. Some days you get up and try to live life and sometimes you’re the pigeon and sometimes you’re the statue. People with schizophrenia can still accomplish stuff. No

But if forced to watch it how it feel like. Negative symptoms are like this. Day to day activities become boring and those who are suffering from it either skip it, delay it or forced to do it with no pleasure or disgust or other emotions. A better definition for negative symptom is affective flattening or blunted affect."

176120119,"It is not the end of coincidences associated with 5, 23, 421 and 7, 29, 139. Sum of last digits in 5, 23, 421 is 9 (5+3+1), in addition, these digits form an arithmetic sequence which ascending counterpart has common difference 2 (additive prime) and has non-composite members. Arithmetic mean of that sequence is 3. By concatenation of two smaller members of 5, 23, 421 we will receive number 523, which is a prime formed by digits being (representing) three smallest primes (also additive ones). By concatenation of sums of digits of numbers of triplet 5, 23, 421 - 5, 5, 7 - we will receive number 557, which is an additive prime number. In addition, 5, 5, 7 are three prime divisors of 175 - sum of numbers in 7, 29, 139. There are interesting 21.7 features associated with sums of numbers in smallest, middle and largest members of triplets 5, 23, 421 and 7, 29, 139 and numbers forming by multiplication of number before and after dots (or just formed by two digits after letter F) in codes F21 (schizotypal 
disorder in ICD-10), F42.2 (mixed obsessive-compulsive disorder in ICD-10) and F84.5 (Asperger’s syndrome in ICD-10). I received these three diagnoses first time together 28.4.2015, above four years earlier. Sum of first numbers (and digits in them) in triplets 5, 23, 421 and 7, 29, 139 is 12 (5+7). Sum of middle numbers in these triplets is 52 (23+29). Sum of largest numbers in these triplets is 560 (421+139). We have received three numbers - 12, 52, 560 . How many digits there are in all three numbers together? 7 . What is sum of these seven digits? 21 ! Let’s look at sums of digits in 12, 52, 560 … 1+2 = 3 5+2 = 7 5+6+0 = 11 What we have received? 3, 7, 11 . Arithmetic sequence with additive primes as members. Its sum of numbers is 21 and its arithmetic mean of numbers is 7 . One of its terms is 7 and product of four digits forming numbers of these sequence is… 21 ! Now let’s look at F21, F42.2, F84.5. Let’s make products of numbers before and after dots (or rewrite number which has no dot afte
r it as it is): 21 -> 21 42.2 -> 42 2 -> 84 84.5 -> 84 5 -> 420 What we have received? 21, 84, 420 . How many digits there are in these three numbers together? 7 . What is the sum of these seven numbers? 21 . 21, 84, 420 is an interesting triplet. How many digits are in the smallest numbers of triplets 12, 52, 560 and 21, 84, 420? Two (2) digits, in 12 and 21. How many digits are in the middle numbers of triplets 12, 52, 560 and 21, 84, 420? Two (2) digits, in 52 and 84. How many digits are in the largest numbers of triplets 12, 52, 560 and 21, 84, 420? Three (3) digits, in 560 and 420. What are last digits in largest numbers of triplets mentioned above? Zeros! 560 ends at 0 and 420 ends at 0. What are numbers formed by two first digits in numbers of triplet 21, 84, 420? 21, 84, 42. If we sort them ascendingly or descendingly, we will receive “miraculous geometrical sequences” - 21, 42, 84 or 84, 42, 21 . What are sums of digits in 21, 42, 84? 3, 6, 12 - also geometric sequence, with sum of numbers 21 and 
arithmetic mean of numbers 7 !"

Also doing a lot of walking, like I’m spending most waking hours outside walking when the weather’s nice. It’s hard though. So hard. It’s such slow going and I’ve had spurts of wanting to give up.

176120133,Some wealthy individuals and some corporations are buying Bitcoin for short-term gains. Bitcoin is not a long-term investment since the cypto-currency was recently introduced. I do not see Bitcoin succeeding unless there is government intervention in its regulation. Bitcoin in speculative in increasing price by speculators which is similar to stock equities in the stock market. Bitcoin is a high risk investment. I don’t know how you can conclude that Bitcoin is a low risk investment. A Central Bank issues fiat paper currency for the public to use. The Central Bank is controlled by the government and you would know this if you had studied macroeconomics.

back on the ambulance as a paramedic… Been over two years sense my last major break cost me to loose my last ambulance job and it has taken me this long to find a job back on the ambulance with my tarnished reputation and the bigotry against me being trans. I’m over the moon to have gotten the job, but I’m also scared of ??????? it up again due to the _PERSON_ still having its flare ups like last night. But overall it’s going well, not easy but things are improving. P.s. sorry for my absence the past few montha"
176120206,How do I know??
176120207,I love this about cats and how they walk around like they own the place.
176120208,I think you are right. I feel sorry for people on the street who aren’t getting any help and maybe won’t even except that they are sick. I feel really blessed. My life is good all things considered.
176120209,That’s a really good piece of advice Thank you… I’m wondering if this is still part of withdrawal from the Invega I stopped 9months ago… or if this is my original illness Half life is about 48days
176120210,Where did I say I have mood issues
176120211,I think my family is supportive I know my Mom is but for the most part we don’t talk about my illness they just know I’m on disability and they let me be
176120212,"I just saw an email from my department chair at the new college. He does not want me teaching the next seven-week semester or either seven-week semester of the winter. Maybe I could teach a simpler course there, like introductory biology, something easy for which I could write my own exams, teaching stuff I already know like the back of my hand. He did say specifically that I am not to teach the Human Biology course. I’ll send him an email Monday. Whatever the case, even if I could teach a simpler course in the winter, I’m losing half of my income until then. This ??????? sucks. I have to start looking for other part-time work. I really don’t want to have to ask for my job back at the gas station. I hated it there, plus I imagine I have been replaced, and there are only so many shifts to go around."
176120213,Do you have sz?
174372619,I have friend who is not on ap I saw him relativly stable than me He may have milder voices who know He is more functional than me I take meds regularly i see that better than no meds at all When i dont take them i live in misery I do shameful acts
174372621,My level was 2000. Then it dropped to around 1800 with abilify added to Lower it. However then it went back up to 1900. So I’ve had to come off paliperidone and now on abilify. Yeah I have all the symptoms of high prolactin. It will take a while to go down.
176120214,I got lucky with Haldol but of late I think I might be washing it out of my system due to my polydipsia. Considering the hospital to get away from the constant work we find to fill the hours… sad to say… and sucky is that I’m deterred because I don’t want to go on the nicotine patch. Probably just venting…
176120215,I agree with u Mr squirrel but I also don’t like to go to the doctor for just anything think I’d like to be last resort kinda thing I mean if I were to start thinking of killing myself or others maybe then I’d be afraid and go see a doc. Also there are so many side affects and stuff from medications that even scientists don’t know about till years later or manufacturers hide from the public till you see settlement offers on commercials.
176120216,With meds. _PHONE_NO_
174372622,"I’m not bipolar at all. I have no symptoms of bipolar at all, but bipolar and schizophrenia commonly pair up. My bipolar “diagnosis” came as the result of my being short, terse, and irritable with my doctor, after always having presented as polite in the past. “Looks like he may be bipolar too. Try him on…” Yup, a bad mood at the wrong time."
176120217,"i dun know what is a psychotics episode, forme i am always psychotic whole time, day &night"
176120218,Women get angry cos it makes us feel inadequate. Like we’re not beautiful enough.
176120219,"I find it weird to be proud of having an illness. It didn’t take any effort for me to get ill. I’m proud of how I’ve managed to reduce how much this illness eats into my life. I’m proud of the things I accomplished in spite of it. I define myself by the things I do or have done, not by the misfortunes that have befallen me."
176120220,I’ve had it a few times recently even when I’ve bathed or showered . I’m wondering how much it could be psychological.
176120221,True. With meds my voices go less easily but still got delusions
176120222,Wow. Happy anniversary _AT_MENTION_ . That is really an impressive number and much respect. I lasted just over two years in marriage but I married someone crazier than me! Well done sir!
176120223,I was making fun of the fbi and cia for reading my mind. I believed it at the time that they were controlling me. There is no way they put a chip in my mind. I have never had my head cut open. Taking meds took this away.
176120224,Sorry but what does keyed up mean?
174372629,Sanity is an interesting concept around here as you’ll find. Read the boards. See what others deal with daily. Your not the only one who needs some advice. Listen to others stories and be positive in the community. Yes your young but we are all going through the same stuff in parts… Be a part of the community and don’t fight it. We really don’t want to fight with people. We want a good community.
176120225,hey there _AT_MENTION_-Cotton I’m doing pretty good. Watched movie today and series and then had a bath. after that we had ribs delivered and i ate those and now i’m listeing music and browsing the forum. How are you doing?
176120226,"This sounds so similar to my voices. Thank you so much for posting. I wish you weren’t suffering like this. I do a lot of “distracting.” I look at memes, play pokemon go and candy crush saga. I watch Modern Family and Big Bang Theory. I love college sports and listen to sports radio. That’s how I cope. The voices sometimes give me trouble when I want to sleep. And when I work part-time. The voices are the religious-type, therefore I often go to the story of Legion in the Bible for reassurance. I also think about slavery and the holocaust in terms of human suffering. This mental illness can be very rough. My voices really torture me, quite often. I’m glad you’re here. (Although it is also saddening.)"
176120227,Have you tried buspar? I’m asking my dr for it the next time I go
176120228,"I told you. It’s the highest form of meditation, the absorption in the object of meditation. After dharana, after dhyana, samadhi"
176120229,What country do you live in? My brother-in-law is a Lawyer. I’ll ask him tomorrow about this.
176120230,"what happens if shizos smoke weed, do they go crazy paranoid. i thought weed was good for the brain."
176120231,"Honestly… yeah. I feel that way. I get on meds and am doing good, and then after a month or two things just go back t feeling like ????. You’re not the only one, I promise. I think the hope is that even if you go through periods of apathy, if you persist then maybe it will get better. Other people are probably more familiar."
176120232,Mostly im talking about thoughts or things that arent allowing your spirit to flourish or develop. So that you always feel free.
176120233,It’s good that you admit this and that you’re willing to talk to the therapist about it. Maybe over time you’ll be able to get a dog
176120234,"i hallucinated shadow agents torturing my auntie and tapping into my mind to torment me as they killed each loved one one by one and sending me psychic livestreams of their torture and murders. naturally, i did not want auntie to die so i called the police to do a check lol. they were like auntie is fine plz come outside to the ambulance and i was like ok just a minute consulted the voices can we do this monday? i have an exam tomorrow. cop: no. me: ok how about saturday? cop: no. me: five hours from now? cop: that is the story of how i ended up in the back of a squad car and then in full restraints in the ambulance. apparently, verbal objections to 5150’s are treated with restraints, too. i hate restraints so much. they always use restraints on me since then, even tho ive never objected to hospitalization after that thinking maybe they wouldnt restrain me if i went voluntarily. nope. restraints always."
176120235,That must be scary! I sometimes also imagine I smell something smoky or burning but this fortunately doesn’t happen a lot Or I’d smell something at random that suddenly reminds me of hospital and my memories of being there come rushing back
176120236,We only can control our lives and others aren’t really under our influence. Sz makes you think about things way too much. At least for me it did so keep things in perspective. It really is hard sometimes but you have no idea what they are doing…let them go and concentrate on yourself. That is more important!
174372628,Probably whatever your voices blame you for.
176120237,I’m planning to talk to my pdoc and get the diagnosis removed if possible

176120242,A couple times I felt apartmentless.
176120243,"Yes, all the time. I learned to not to care. It’s real enough. The reason why I suffered so much is because my sensory perception was all screwed up and jacked up for years. It has returned to normal. After deep philosophical thinking for years, I realized it doesn’t matter if things aren’t that real as we think they are. Even if we are brains in a vat, the brain is still technically real and the vat is too…it’s a matter of perception and just a level of detail or nuance. It’s just another layer anyways. And what about outside the vat? Something must be real. I mean people freak out about atoms or probably used to…at least. Now scientists think we are just vibrating strings ie musical notes and the composer is God or whatever."

176120246,A simple todo list helps me such as seriously writing down simple things like have breakfast Brush teeth Take rubbish out Get dressed Do something activity I can do Eat lunch etc and tick off after you have done it. Be super kind to yourself. Take sleeping tablets if you can’t sleep because sleep is so important. I almost had relapse a few times but managed to stay good by doing this. Tell someone you trust. Love to you n hope u feel better soon.

174372627,"Thanks so far that seems like the best two options. She actually wants to try Abilify so hopefully it works well. I think it would a lot less sedating and her symptoms of restlessness and movement issues might go away. I think Abilify is worse for diabetes as far as it causing possible sedation/weight gain, but she’s got that under control mostly."
176120248,"When I was on Latuda I was angry. It might have been withdrawal from Geodon and Seroquel. I think I was taking a gaba drug at the time, and coming off that was what was affecting my mood. I asked to go back on Geodon and Seroquel. I’ve given up on finding some kind of designer drug that will make me a marvel of social adjustment. If it controls my symptoms it’s okay."

176120253,I am not sure. I think you would have to be a danger to yourself or others.
176120254,It is best to just live with them. Success stories with meds are only a few on here. Does it give you a fighting chance? If so then you are on to something.
174372635,Abilify is worse than cocaine for me.
174372632,"Why dont you find a little job ( if your meds are cheap ). Have new meeting, few friend, social life and maybe youll find a girlfriend ( average one ), go out cinema, you know ‘’ life’’. As me a schizophrenic, friends come and go they not family, so just make friends, tons of them, go out and chat. And uh… One thing left, dont yell out ‘‘schizophrenic’’ all the time, keep it."

176120257,"I’m at the opposite end of the spectrum, I’ve maybe spent 2 or 3 years total in long term relationships. Haven’t dated since I got diagnosed ago 5 years ago at age 30. I just keep contact with family and have a good relationship with any pets. The forum helps also. I can’t imagine having been in a relationship for that stretch of time, but then again I’m not a very handsome person."
174372631,"My story is that I was diagnosed in 2009, shortly after the financial crisis. I am 31, yet was diagnosed when I was 20. The medication makes me very unhappy and makes it impossible to do my work — I try to study but most of this time is just wasted because I can’t concentrate. Yet I need to stay on the medication for the time being, because every time I’ve had it reduced significantly, it has had a bad effect on my health. The fact these drugs suppress dopamine just goes to show that your ‘reward system’ gets screwed up by these drugs and the reward system is what allows your to learn more. I never had hallucinations, just had delusions and some aggression which is quite out of character. I was diagnosed with schizophrenia."

It’s the body’s way of releasing all of the pent up cortisol and oxytocin and such so you can regain equilibrium. Is it possible you didn’t notice the stress hormones building up because you are used to having higher levels? Try to pay attention to what happened in the times before you started crying, to see if you can spot some warning signs. And remember: crying is a good thing. It releases all the icky chemicals your body needs to get rid of. You usually feel better after it’s over."

174372640,"I feel like I am a failure. I don’t know. If it was just this life or one life, I wouldn’t mind, but it keeps on happening like I keep reliving my life like Groundhog day since my schizophrenia for eternity. I tried escaping, stopping it, and stuff, but I keep going back in time and going through the same motions at the mental hospital, riding in the _NAME_, etc with other mentally ill folk. Feels like life is a computer or simulation and I see things change slightly due to quantum events, fluctuations, brain cells, and stuff and possibly other people able to change things or due to the butterfly effect, which is ???????? and sucks. I cannot change my genetics. I never studied biology or anything and as an autstic person, I hate biology because it’s a soft science and kind of elementary compared to the other subjects, I have no interest in it, and hate all that ???? involved. In high school, it was my favorite or best subject, but too easy and I realize that . I’m more interested in chemist
ry, computers, math, physics, etc. It has to do with my autistic brain and I watched some documentaries on it that people like me aren’t attracted to those soft fields which are more for like females I suppose. So I never cure my own illness. I felt like I was a doctor or tried to be a doctor in a past life, but other than basic biology, I don’t even know how I got into med school – 99% sure I didn’t graduate – (delusion?) – and not sure how I passed or even took the MCAT because of biology. I remember taking lots of chemistry and ????. Don’t remember any of it. I think I had a CS major background – probably online…I would love to be a doctor but am unorthodox and probably just want the damn schizophrenia cured. I care and want to help people. I know after I learned how to cook in a group home in a past life, I tried being a psychiatrist. Cooking skills lead to independent life and frontal lobe abilities and gave me motivation and drive. I wanted to help people and make money. Furthermore, I 
was motivated more back then. I also remember attending a Christian med school but have recall I didn’t do well or was in danger of failing my classes – especially the religious ones. It’s hard when I am so convinced and believe I live in a computer simulation created by God. I even talk to Him and He talks back, so I guess I’m crazy. I even believed in one of my very first lives, I was a surgeon, but then again, I most likely wasn’t. I probably was an investment banker, which is what I was told or felt on the TV in a past life. I get memories of past lives or recall while dreaming and awake like flashbacks and even being on MARs which is fake and ????????. I thought about Mars a lot and how they found water or air under the rocks recently in the news – I think if IRC – and how it sort of was like in the book “Total Recall” by PKD – I don’t know if it’s a coincidence or not, but it changes the dynamics of things. Is this schizophrenia? Autistic mutant powers of cognition and pattern re
cognition? lol? I don’t know. But I keep being literally reset back in time like a video game to the beginning of my illness. Happened so many times and there’s literally no proof except my story and experiences. I feel like crying a lot of times."

176120313,Thanks _AT_MENTION_. Fortunately once I got on higher dose of meds Alien quietened down. But he does lurk in background still… going to get in touch with mental health professionals soon I hope. My usual pdoc handed me over to state sector pdocs as he said my mental health problems too complex for him to treat. So I’m without pdoc at moment

176120316,"During the first month after the sz birth ,and when the bilateral conflict scenarios arise between the original psychological user And the parasitic entities ( conscious pathogen) throughout the exchanging the higher information (ideas ) Two phenomena appear on the conscious state of the human being; The first is the inability of a specific mechanism to suppress the sequence of the phonetic thoughts that issued by the psychological parasite (pathogen - the things that you call hallucinations) in the time-place of the person’s conscious state the second is the lack of response of this mechanism to the distress calls that be issued from the psychological will of the user ,therefore the mind of this user becomes like as if the mind is a driver of a car without break most time of waking The audible phonetic thoughts cascade one by one in the conscious mind theater without stopping / rest with inability to inhibit the relay of the spoken transmitters of the pathogen NOTHING inside or outside can stop 
(mute) the sequence of the vocal transmitters of pathogen ,because the pathogen (the emitter of the spoken transmitters ) is not a neuron ,or it is not a part from the brain structure !! It seems that,as if the primary task of the brain is to control (regulate) the speed of the original transmitter during its pass from the emitter cell to the receptor cells Adjust the transmitter speed by specific degree, so that the process of transmission and reception takes a period of time ( T seconds) that allows the mind to read (understands) the thought’s meaning ( the meaning content of the cognitive message that be carried by the transmitter )"

176120321,"Ok, you know that my meds dont help me much, not on my mental or even my body… but I tried to stop them 2 years ago and I ended up not eating or sleeping, with a rushing mind, not being able to get up from my bed… My mind was so rushing, that it was life threatening… so my zyprexa helps a bit on this. With it, I eat and sleep and get up from the bed, but it didnt help my sz mind at all yeap… My situation is bad since 20 years too now in fact… no activity or socializing… I gave up 20 years ago and here I am now… now I am a bit more active, but I still do few and am probably still sick and delusional as hell… I wont even speak about my fears and the conversion disorder lol… But the common people know, that the meds kill us too… they slow us down and it’s harder to move on them… even my pdoc agreed, that they harm in a way… Should I stop them then?? Cause I am very low functioning despite them too? Tbh, my question is even superfluous cause I know how close to death I was wit
hout them… It’s just that some people manage to do it without them, but I guess it’s not my case… Tbh, I just now talked to my online bf and I felt something good for a second, that’s why I am thinking about the meds now… maybe I have problems accepting even now, that I am sick. I also dont understand why not even a single med, didnt make me happier one pdoc was wondering too cause I’ve tried all the 11s here on the market, yeah… My pdoc was saying that my illness went chronical too… Take care all"

176120360,"The process probably varies by state too. While it was a pain in the ass applying multiple times, I did not have to go through any court proceedings or anything like that so it was relatively stress free. It was hard to get, but with the proper amount of documentation and tests I was able to get it after several years. I guess my point is you don’t necessarily have to go to court to get it done but if you do have to go to court I could see where some stress might enter into it. Showing lots of hospitalizations, lack of work and the results of my tests was enough in my case."

I did pretty bad stuff in Canada when I was unmedicated and psychotic and I think they are coming to punish me… The police know me from bringing to the hospital so they know where to get me. The Korean government is after me too because they believe I’m dangerous. They are working with the Canadian government to arrest me and put me into the mental asylum. Help. I feel like I’m going crazy. I feel like I need to run away before I get arrested.

The last few months over been pretty bad about only eating a few servings a day. I did better when vegetables we’re my main food source."

Then I saw my latest hospital (internal) psychiatrist until he transferred me to an external out of hospital pdoc. I have been with this external pdoc for 2 years and he’s the most relaxing and quiet psychiatrist. He only talks about most important stuff and don’t waste my time."

Plus, it lasted 20 years, even more… Can the zyprexa lift the emotional pain in fact? Is it in its power?.."
176120419,"No. Not redness, swelling or warm. It is just pain"

I don’t know the in-depth quantum mechanics involved there (something to do with Orchestrated Objective Reduction,) but the metaphysical aspect seems directly correlated with the amount of inflammation I have, which itself determines how much adrenochrome there is. No inflammation, no adrenochrome, no symptoms. No _NAME_ show."
174372684,I gained over a 100 pounds since being on Medications for Schizoaffective Disorder its frustrating and aggravating as hell to go up and down on the scale right now I am keeping my weight the same which is better than gaining. But I really need to still lose a lot of weight I have been going to the gym three days a week have lost 17 pounds so far but haven’t lost anymore and I have been going to the gym for almost a year now. I will never ever give up that someday I will be much thinner than I am but its hard to lose that extra weight I am still obese I just have to work harder at it than someone who isn’t on meds for mental illness. I am a fighter and determined to beat this problem that’s been a problem for many years for me. Have tried diet pills that made me manic and gave me chest pains all accept Alli which is just so expensive and plus pills make me sick taking them even swallowing them is a problem luckily I can take my other meds cause their relatively small to take but big pills pose 
a problem for me to take. Thinking of amping up my work out routine instead of three days a week I may start going 5 days a week for a hour at the gym and see if I make progress then wish me luck everyone will keep everyone posted if I finally make progress.
176120423,My cholesterol is controlled by statins already. If I intentionally start adding these things to my diet it might make things worse on this as well It’s just so hard for me to know what to do The other day I completely lost my strength tipping a wheelbarrow into a skip and it fell over.

176120429,"Yes of course. Sorry if I was being an ass to you yesterday - I am not very good at controlling impulses, or knowing when to shut up sometimes. My issue, not yours"
176120430,"I had several “sure things” when I was younger in my twenties and I let the opportunities slip away. It especially stings me now because I never had confidence with women and any luck I had was hard earned and I had to fight (figuratively) for every single, little opportunity that came my way or any favors that women showed towards me. Yeah. I regret that. Nevertheless, I got to make some memories."
176120431,"Unfortunately there is a whole group of people on the internet who say things like that all of the time. It’s for shock value or just to be funny. (I dont think it’s funny, I’m just saying they do) Its creepy and wrong from a normal perspective, but inside that group of people it is not only considered funny, but people are encouraged to do stuff like that.

174372678,I would report the person but the incident I had took place before the site switched over. I had to create a new account a couple years ago. I saw the speech the girl made on youtube after I created a new account. I have no way of finding out what her user name was.

176120435,? don t mind erotic movies and standard type pornography.but some of them really like nightmares. . ? don t really aggree about sex should be a industry. Because what is making sex interesting and complicate feeling is love.other than sex is really pale feeling.
176120436,Om if it’s worth anything to you you’re one of the chillest persons here. You have that going for you. Even though you seem bothered by such thoughts. At least you have a great humility That’s what I admire most about u
176120437,Very often i feel that nothing exists
176120438,I’ve only tried those energy drinks a handful of times. My stepdaughter gets one every time she takes me shopping .
176120439,"so i’m on the panel and i may be speaking about the video we made about the clubhouse model and how our clubhouse helps members, i am taking my mum so she’ll hopefully see and hear everything and hopefully doesnt show me up lol, i dont want to be embarrassed"
176120440,If after meeting his therapist he’s not getting better I’d try looking for a new one. There are many to choose from and he needs the best one for him
176120441,"I agree. Crystals don’t do anything to water, either."
176120442,Guitar. I have one. Can’t and don’t play.
176120443,I see. That’s good news. Happy for you! I had a similar issue with olzanipine. And I’m currently on aripiprazole and considering lurasidone. How are your negatives?
176120444,"prazosin. It stops bad dreams in their tracks. It’s a miracle med. I don’t know what I would have done without it for the periods when I was so bad. Definitely talk to your pdoc about it. It’s just a blood pressure med that you take 1mg at a time until you have relief of symptoms, once you find the right mg you can take it prn. So if your not having nightmares you can skip, then if you’re going a rough patch you just take it again. It works great. I think it’s worth checking out if nightmares or bad dreams cause you a problem."
176120445,"I showered and had salad. I will call my friend soon to talk and to play an online video game, Call of Duty."
176120446,"so I don’t get it, how is it possible, that one of the most flourishing countries in the world has no public health insurance? this is suck! sorry guys but after I hear what you are getting there, I wanna cry for you…"
176120447,Thanks for sharing your experiences. The most probable is that caregivers try we not compare/dévalorize us too much and as you say to push us up in order to maintain motivation and positive thought. Maybe they are sometimes clumsy.
176120448,"I find the hallucinations are more vivid at night, when I’m trying to avoid them I go to bed earlier. That way if I see anything, I tell myself its just a dream."
176120449,Fight that ticking clock with everything you got.
176120450,I was wondering if anybody really every had breakdown symptoms like me. I’ll tell you what they are. I start to think I’m in hell and the TV will like start talking about me in different ways. That’s my main symptoms.i could go into it further but it really gets complicated and scary And to top it off I’m due for my shot and only have 2 paliperdone to last me through today and the weekend and it takes 4 3mg pills to get me right. I have a question about my doctor also. I told her the truth that I have to take 4 pills to get right but she only wants me taking one. She gave me 7 pools last month or before to last till my next appt. I don’t know if she thinks I’m abusing them but she don’t give me many. What should I tell her when I go to see her Monday. Should I say I just took one and lie or tell her the truth that I have to take 4 again which I already told her and see what she says? Like how should I approach that situation?
176120451,"I am absolutely with you on this, especially lately. I bounce between a handful of ideas, like the simulation theory (maybe my whole life has been one, maybe it just now started and isn’t taking properly, etc), reincarnation (maybe I’m not _PERSON_, maybe I’m just remembering several past lives), and more recently I’ve been hooked on the idea that our souls (or energy or whatever you feel comfortable saying) have lived THIS life many many times and have simply made different choices, creating several timelines or alternate planes of existence right next to ours. We’re all susceptible to others’ energies, maybe some people are susceptible to other things?"
176120452,"Thanks, I like to do minatures."
176120453,me too =D very nice!
176120455,This is a mess. I don’t think we were well-equipped as a society to deal with this at all. The UK Finance minister was pretty blunt about how bad the economy will be after (Or even if) Covid-19 becomes less of a problem. I want a universal basic income for everyone and I hope it goes in that direction as bail outs for business and individuals is not a long term or sustainable solution
174372683,"I haven’t been following this thread, but I have always stated that masturbation was one of the first symptoms of my schizophrenia which made it worse. Chinese pulse readers, if I can use a specific term to differentiate between modes of medicine, claim that there is a difference between the neurotic pulse after masturbation and the healthy pulse after sex. My theory based on brainwave entrainment is that sexual stimulation synchs the brainwaves with whatever is the focus of the stimulation. Thus in healthy sex you synch with your partner, in masturbation you synch with whatever you are masturbating over, which is usually a combination of external artificial stimulus and yourself. For me, since I always thought porn was exploitative, I _NAME_ pictures to masturbate over, meaning that I was entraining my mind with myself even more extremely. Such self-feedback loops can distance oneself from the wave structure of the environment, leading to dissassociative thinking which can cause psychosis. There 
is nothing religious about this. It can even be empowering as self-feedback loops so often are, it depends on what you concentrate on, which is why the likes of _PERSON_, not to mention the Pharoahs of Egypt, practiced it ritualistically to manifest change. However, for me, it being derived from earlier sickness of unrealised schizophrenia, it only made things worse. Sex education has a lot to answer for."
176120456,"Woof, can’t even remember because it’s been so long"
176120457,_AT_MENTION_ I am referring to the ‘‘energy’’ used in the organ the brain is on par with special moments of a genius coming up with new break throughs for humanity …yes a psychotic episode energy wise matches it…the whole brain is used
176120458,"Some have it, its an option. I am talking about the AC that has outlets in every room of the house. Its big like that:"
176120459,Today I had to do some work in the yard. In the end I got derealization and I can’t recognize the objects around me. I don’t know where I am
176120460,No you can’t hear thoughts.
176120461,"Do you have the entire video? Haven’t seen it in a while. You made me smile, so, thanks! How’s the starlet doing?"
174372690,"omg. that has to suck. Still, can’t she prescribe you your antipsychotics? You don’t know if they can knock this delusion out of you until you’ve tried them all, up to and including clozapine. I don’t know what else to suggest. You sure sound like you need a med adjustment."
176120462,"My dx is SzA but I relate better to late-onset Sz. I got sick for the first time when I was 38. I am just now coming off of yet another psychotic break and I feel that commuting with others who understand my problems and process really helps. I smoke non-stop. I drink coffee but I broke it as my worst habit. I used to not drink water at all. I am in an online program and I’ve been taking online courses for the past three years. I’ve earned a degree and am now working on a supplementary certificate program. Sometimes I get so sick I can’t function, but I have been lucky with school, for the most part. I have had to drop a course now and then. Coming off of a recent psychotic break. I relapsed and admitted myself to the hospital a couple of weeks ago for the first time in about four years. I was mildly psychotic earlier this year, but this time it is worse. I’ve been sleeping on my mom’s sofa for about two months. I like watercolors and I recently bought an acoustic guitar to keep me busy a
nd engaged, but I am bad about being self-motivated. I also write and am waiting to see if one of my pieces can be published in a lit journal. With all that, I still feel unproductive and lacking. I had a good career and I miss working. Thanks for reading and I look forward to getting to know each of you."
176120464,Sometimes we rip things open in therapy and it hurts before it gets better. I had that experience in dealing with trauma. But I don’t think that therapy should be making you less functional. That sounds like something is going wrong. I’m sorry you have difficulty in switching therapists but I kind of think that’s what needs to happen. Sometimes it’s not a good fit and sometimes they are just not a good therapist. I hope things get better for you.
176120465,have your gp doc take an ECG… then they can see if there is anything wrong with your heart
176120466,"I’ve read the symptoms and I fit more to that diagnosis and my psych has been trying to diagnose me for a long time now just perplexed. She wont give me the sz or sza diagnosis cause I’m an ex addict and my depression is prominent. I’m looking to talk to fellow with the dx. It doesnt matter my diagnosis. I just know its severe and need to talk to others who can relate. Im depressed, suicidal, have intrusive thoughts of guilt, cant think straight. I’m also very scared"
