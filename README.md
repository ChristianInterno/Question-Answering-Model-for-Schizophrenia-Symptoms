## üìñ Overview

In recent years, the emphasis on mining medical data using machine learning techniques has grown exponentially. This project presents a new methodology for building a medical dataset and designing a QA model to analyze symptoms and their daily life impact for a specific disease domain. The main focus is on Schizophrenia, a mental disorder that affects millions worldwide.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset originates from the "Mental Health" forum, dedicated to individuals suffering from schizophrenia and other mental disorders. The corpus consists of:
- 415,602 posts
- Respective IDs 
- Dates posted by different users

## üõ† Tools & Techniques

- **Fine-tuned Models**: BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and BioBERT.
- **Haystack**: A framework for end-to-end QA systems.
- **Fine-tuning**: The models are rapidly fine-tuned for specific tasks with relatively fewer labels.

## üìà Results

By fine-tuning the BioBERT QA model, we achieved:
- F1 Score: 0.885
- Notable improvement over state-of-the-art models in the mental disorders domain.

## ü§ù Contribution

We welcome contributions! Whether it's improving the model, enhancing the dataset, or providing feedback, feel free to make a pull request or open an issue.
