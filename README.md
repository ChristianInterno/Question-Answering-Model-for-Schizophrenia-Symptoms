The model can be rapidly fine-tuned on a specific downstream task with relatively few labels.

## Final RoBERTa v2 trained model
RoBERTa is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised way. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labeling them in any way, with an automatic process to
generate inputs and labels from those texts.
