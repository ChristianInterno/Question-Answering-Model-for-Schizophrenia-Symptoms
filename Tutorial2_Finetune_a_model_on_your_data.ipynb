ways to generate training data\n","\n","1. **Annotation**: You can use the [annotation tool](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack#labeling-tool) to label your data, i.e. highlighting answers to your questions in a document. The tool supports structuring your workflow with organizations, projects, and users. The labels can be exported in SQuAD format that is compatible for training with Haystack.\n","\n","![Snapshot of the annotation tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepset-ai/haystack/master/docs/_src/img/annotation_tool.png)\n","\n","2. **Feedback**: For production systems, you can collect training data from direct user feedback via Haystack's [REST API interface](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack#rest-api). This includes a customizable user feedback API for providing feedback on the answer returned by the API. The API provides a feedback export endpoint to obtain the feedback data for fine-tuning your model further.\n","\n","\n","## Fine-tune your model\n","\n","Once you have collected training data, you
